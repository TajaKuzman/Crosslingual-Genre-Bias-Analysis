It's not the same highway, it's just about the shares here, which EBRD thinks are cost effective and it was for the complete network through CG ...  Montenegro: 'Business of the Century' received the Greek-Israeli Consortium  ... thanks ... Does that mean that for other shares, tenders still apply ??? ...  That's it..IGH is no longer in a bad post and we are at the levels from a few years ago.Very good, very good.  ... but it's not fair ... Maybe for that part and our consortium would get guarantees ... or not so ??? ... ...  Our consortium gave a pre -radical offer -a valuable and calculation that is not worthwhile, their fortune that it is not accepted and have not received guarantees, otherwise they would all go to 3MP, and the banks did not meet them with their wishes precisely because of the size and unprofitable of the abovethe project and the situation itself in the construction sector with us.  I hope that after this text, one part of the dead (quasi) shareholders who wrote praise in connection with this job and the heights of the shares, finally to permeate their misconceptions and in the future more carefully socialize and make the wider folk investment investors (small burazers)Based on unverified rumors, gossip, or one's desires and writing.

Tridesete godine u Njemačkoj, doba je Weimarske Republike. Čokoladni magnat i ruski emigrant Hermann Hermann (D. Bogarde) polako ali sigurno tone u ludilo. Kako Njemačka nije tako gostoljubiva kao prije, Hermann sanja o bijegu od svega. Počelo je s doživljajima napuštanja vlastitoga tijela kad vodi ljubav sa svojom ženom Lydiom (A. Ferréol), pri čemu on sjedi u stolcu i sve to promatra. Slijedili su ispadi s radnicima, poslovnim partnerima i neznancima... Ton ovoga filma je ironičan kao što je u istoimenom romanu Vladimira Nabokova prema kojem je scenarij napisao poznati britanski dramatičar, rodom Čeh, Tom Stoppard. Na festivalu u Cannesu 1978. redatelj Rainer Werner Fassbinder nominiran je za Zlatu palmu. Iste je godine u Njemačkoj film dobio tri nagrade: za najboljeg redatelja, fotografiju i produkciju.

Zato mlinski kotač dan i noć se kreće, Bisernicu vodu, kamen brašno meće.                             Šumom šumi voda, ruši se i hita. Ljudi jedni nutar, drugi grnu van. Šiba tuče: “ti ta, ti ta, nosi žita”. “Ti vreću na ovu, ti na onu stran! Tko je kašnje došo, pričekaj do reda!” Drzovitim glasom mlinar zapovijeda.                             Prvi što su došli oko mliva čeplju: Jedan puši lulu, drugog hvata drijem; Neki kamenare gleda opet nijem, Gdje po dvoru trošne kamenove kleplju Neki bud se šale, budi krko zbore, Na štibru se tuže, bud glavare kore.                             Ni mlinaru nitko neće ostat dužan: čim su tašće vreće, tim on bolje sit. Bila suša sada, leda l’ teglo bit; Bio Božić južan, gore nego kužan: Njegov mu je, vele, svim uprkos strujam Sve nadosut moguć krivi onaj ujam.                             U njega ti ima preubava kćerka, Gužvica joj stasak, lice šipak rud, Namamne joj oči, grude snijega grud, Hitra – kano laka vjeverica zvjerka U svem ti je gledno, milosno čeljade; Samo joj za jednu pogrešku se znade.

Kolovoz/august. Što rade novinari kad ostanu bez vijesti?                             Zovu Boru Đorđevića da im kaže kada će nastupati u Zagrebu, a oni, valjda njemu zauzvrat uplate listić (tiket) na 4 para. Ukratko to je sažetak priče u kojoj se Đorđević, nekako u isto doba ukazuje u medijima te malo potpali vatru na vječnu temu srpsko-hrvatskih odnosa.                             Konkretno, nedavno je uskočio jednom srpskom listu s izjavom da postoji ideja o nastupu u Zagrebu, i da bi mu bila čast ako se to dogodi. Posljednji put je takva priča bila aktivna pred Schengenfest 2012., kada je jedan od glavnih izvođača upravo bio Đorđevićev sastav Riblja čorba. Nedugo nakon toga Čorba je izdala novi album, tako da cijela halabuka podsjeća samo na dobru reklamnu strategiju iz interesa s budžetom od jako malo eura.                             Ili ne? Insajderi bliski organizatorima koncerata kažu da se potiho, svo ovo vrijeme, uistinu pregovara o koncertu Riblje čorbe u Zagrebu. A znate kako završava priča u kojoj dječak stalno viče: “Vuk!”? Na kraju se vuk pojavi i nikog ne bude briga, tako da možda Čorba i dođe u Zagreb. I nikog ne bude briga?                             	195	Pushing principles as a cheap media strategy when is the time of the year when there is the least news? August/August. What do journalists do when they run out of news? They call Boro Djordjevic to tell them when they will perform in Zagreb, and they, I guess in return, pays him a leaf on 4 pairs. In short, this is a summary of the story in which Djordjevic, somehow, appears in the media at the same time and fell a little fire on the eternal topic of Serbo-Croatian relations. In particular, he recently jumped in a Serbian list with a statement that there was an idea of ​​performing in Zagreb, and that it would be his honor if that happened. The last time such a story was active before Schengenfest 2012, when one of the main performers was Djordjevic's composition of a fishing broth. Shortly afterwards, Corba released a new album, so the whole halabuk reminds only a good advertising strategy out of interest with a budget of very little euros. Or not? Insiders close to the organizers of the concert say that he is quietly, all this time, really negotiating a concert of a fish broth in Zagreb. And you know how the story ends in which the boy constantly shouts, "Wolf!"? In the end, the wolf appears and no one cares, so maybe Corba came to Zagreb. And no one cares?

Mladi Riječani koji stoje iza “Drugog para rukava” smatraju da iza svakog dobrog proizvoda stoji dobra priča, stoga su odlučili prikazati povijest Rijeke kroz ilustriranu priču koja bi na neki način oživjela taj komadić povijesti. Iako su majice edukativne, dizajnom su prilagođene mlađoj populaciji koja bi ih ponosno mogla nositi na svojim putovanjima, a interesantnim spojem vizualnog i verbalnog pobuđuju znatiželju te podsjećaju javnost na riječke zanimljivosti i bogatstvo grada. Dizajn je dijelom preuzet iz konteksta povijesti a dijelom prilagođen urbanom vizualnom jeziku, dok su poruke često dvosmislene. Uz svaku majicu dobije se i njezina priča tako da nema straha od nepotkovanosti informacijama.                             Dosad su realizirane četiri majice: priča o Riječkoj tvornici konopa, o tvornici čokolade Elefant, o Rafineriji šećera i o Baltazar Gradu, no serija motiva dalje će se razvijati. Vrijeme je da se Rijeka i Riječani počnu hvaliti svojim gradom i širiti njegovu baštinu, a u tome će im pomoći i riječki Zaštitnici koji, svaki na sebi svojstven način, imaju misiju prenositi riječ o Rijeci što dalje. Više detalja o pričama možete naći na http://www.facebook.com/DrugiParRukava.                             Projekt je dobio podršku Turističke zajednice grada Rijeke koja mu je dodijelila certifikat suvenira Izvorno riječko. Ovi novi promotori Rijeke zasad se mogu pogledati i kupiti u riječkom Kantoon Shopu, Pod Kašelom 5. Dobra priča daleko se čuje, stoga kada sljedeći put budete u nedoumici što darovati rođaku u Njemačkoj – pravac Kantoon Shop!

Da li se po vama isplate sve ekskluzivne stvari koje dobijete preko kampanje ? Pri tome ne mislim na financijsku stranu, nego kako se sve te dodatne stvari uklope u igru. Da li stvarno fukncioniraju sa igrom koju ste kupili ili rađe igrate osnovnu igru sa ekspanzijama? Dakle govorim o Kickstarter ekskluzivama, ne o onome što je kasnije dostupno preko maloprodaje. Pitam najviše radi najave Rising suna. Volim temu feudalnog Japana, moram vidjeti kako je Lang osmislio kombinaciju Blood Ragea i Diplomacija.                             ja sam nedavno uzeo na KS Massive Darkness. Meni prva CMoN igra preko KS... ovdje možeš pogledati razliku onog što se može kupiti i ono šta se dobije u osnovnom KS https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/15 ... r-editions ako gledaš samo ekskluzive, samo dobiješ više monstera i heroja... ali u ovom KS-u, količina koja se dobije je odlična...                             Ja sam uzeo preko KS-a i tek sam jučer dobio mail da je poslana igra iz njemačke.. Igra fakat puno kasni i ljudi su razočarani. I to bi sve bilo ok.. Ali kad ti proizvođač kaže da je igra gotova i da samo treba naštancat kopije te da ćeš dobiti igru prije nego dođe u dućane... Za Massive Darkness pretpostavljam će kasniti jer još razrađuju...                             Danas se pojavio Mare Nostrum, s obzirom da se poklonjenom konju ne gleda u zube... bolje ikad nego nikad :)                             ono kaj definitivno mogu pohvaliti kod igre (prije samog igranja) da su misli na insert. u core box stane exp i dodatak sa zgradama..i to bez nekih većih problema.                             	259	The question for all of you who supported which of the Coolminiornot (CMON) kickstarter campaign. Do you pay for all the exclusive things you get through the campaign? I do not mean financial side, but how all these additional things fit into the game. Do you really fuccate with the game you have bought or plague you play a basic game with expansion? So I'm talking about kickstarter exclusives, not what is later available through retail. I ask the most for the announcement of Rising Suna. I love the topic of feudal Japan, I have to see Lang designed a combination of Blood Rage and diplomacy. I recently took the KS Massive Darkness. My first cmon plays via KS ... here you can see the difference of what can be bought and what is obtained in the basic KS https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/15 ... r- editions if you only look at exclusives, You just get more monsters and heroes ... but in this KS, the quantity is excellent ... I took via KS and only yesterday I got a mail that a game was sent from Germany .. Playing a Fakat Lotsly And people are disappointed. And that would be okay .. but when the manufacturer tells you that the game is over and that just needs to get copies and you will get the game before he comes to stores ...

Forum		The question for all of you who supported which of the Coolminiornot (CMON) kickstarter campaign.Do you pay for all the exclusive things you get through the campaign?I do not mean financial side, but how all these additional things fit into the game.Do you really fuccate with the game you have bought or plague you play a basic game with expansion?So I'm talking about kickstarter exclusives, not what is later available through retail.I ask the most for the announcement of Rising Suna.I love the topic of feudal Japan, I have to see Lang designed a combination of Blood Rage and diplomacy.  I recently took the KS Massive Darkness.My first cmon plays via KS ... here you can see the difference of what can be bought and what is obtained in the basic KS https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/15 ... r- editions if you only look at exclusives,You just get more monsters and heroes ... but in this KS, the amount that gets is great ...  I took it via KS and only yesterday I got a mail that a game was sent from Germany .. Playing a fact a lot late and people are disappointed.And that would be okay .. but when the manufacturer tells you that the game is over and that just needs to get a copy and you will get the game before he comes to the stores ... For Massive Darkness I suppose they will be late because they are still elaborating ...  Mare Nostrum appeared today, since he doesn't look at the gifted horse in his teeth ...

Učlanjivanje je počelo prošlu subotu prije utakmice Guingamp –Monaco, a članarina košta 40 eura.                             Nepunih šest dana od početka Guingamp je već prošao brojku od 7.000 članova. Brojka je respektabilna za tako kratko razdoblje, ali i još respektabilnija kad se uzme u obzir da prema popisu stanovništva iz 2014. godine Guingamp ima 7.003 stanovnika!                             Da podsjetimo, učlanjivanje traje do 29. travnja i utakmice Guingamp–St. Etienne. Guingamp dolazi iz francuske regije Bretanje iz koje još dolaze prvoligaši Nantes, Rennes, Lorient i prvoplasirani drugoligaš Brest. Klub se nakon 27. odigranih kola nalazi na odličnoj 10. poziciji ljestvice.                             	111	Guingamp: More members than inhabitants less than a month ago we wrote about a socios project in French first -team Guingamp. The joining began last Saturday before the Guingamp -Monaco match, and the membership fee costs 40 euros. For less than six days from the start of Guingamp, it has already passed the figure of 7,000 members. The figure is respectable for such a short period, but also even more respectable when considering that according to the 2014 census, Guingamp has 7003 inhabitants! Let's remind you that joining lasts until April 29 and the Guingamp -St. Etienne. Guingamp comes from the French region Bretanje from which the first -team Nantes, Rennes, Lorient and the first -ranked second -team player are still coming. After the 27th rounds played, the club is in the excellent 10th position of the ladder.

Naravno u svakom od ovih benefita uvijek na prvo mjesto moramo staviti umjerenost u konzumiranju, odnosno odgovorno uživanje viskija.                             Donosimo deset razloga, odnosno činjenica zbog kojih bi svakog dana trebali popiti čašicu viskija.                             Spriječite i izliječite prehladu. Viski je je zapravo vrlo učinkovit kao sirup protiv kašlja jer alkohol uništava i ispire nakupljene bakterije u našem grlu. Ako pa ga pomiješamo sa limunovim sokom i toplom vodom, uz dašak meda za slatki okus, vrlo lako možemo ovim napitkom spriječiti, ali i izliječiti prehladu. Na kraju krajeva, jesen je na vratima i ovo može biti kao fino vruće piće za grijanje tijela u hladnim jesenskim danima (i noćima).                             Poživite duže. Iako ne postoji formula za vječni život, viski je od nekad na pravom putu za produljenje životnog vijeka, a to možemo zahvaliti priličnoj količini antioksidansa i hranjivih tvari u njemu. Upravo zbog toga viski daje određeni poticaj našem imunološkom sustavu što pak pomaže u prevenciji raznih bolesti. Ti antioksidansi također sprječavaju razgradnju važnih stanica u tijelu, što dovodi do dužeg životnog vijeka.                             Pomaže probavi. Ova voda života se kao dodatak prehrani koristi već desetljećima. Pomaže u obuzdavanju apetita čime se sprječava prejedanje koje pak može dovesti do grčeva u trbuhu i drugih probavnih smetnji.

Ali od kud vam 45 milijardi?                             Ali Vi ste to govorili, vaša Vlada je govorila 45 milijardi da koštaju zahtjevi sindikata i sad odjednom to imamo.                             2038., odnosno, 2033.                             Ja se bojim da je jedini koji je plašio ljude, su bili ovakvi stavovi i ovakve analize vrlo paušalnih neovisnih analitičara. Vlada je tada, a i sada, zagovara činjenicu.                             Ovo nije potez ministra Pavića.                             Prije se plašilo s 45 milijardi, nije ih se imalo, a sad ta računica se pojavila. Promovirali ste reformu, sad je odjednom sve to nepotrebno.                             Dakle, promovirali smo reformu i danas je promoviramo. O pozitivnim efektima u ovom trenutku nitko ne želi pričati. Jedino su ministi ti koji se usude reći da je mirovina u zadnje dvije godine porasla 11 posto. Da su one minimalne mirovine rasle više od 15 posto.                             Gdje je ministar Pavić? Jesmo li ga trebali danas čuti? Treba li biti smijenjen?                             Ne. Ministar Pavić u ovom trenutku pregovara i razgovara. Novu financijsku lokaciju u Bruxellesu. On će se vratiti sutra u Hrvatsku i sva ova pitanja koja danas apostrofirate i imputirate nekim drugim ministrima moći ćete sutra pitati ministra Pavića.                             Zašto smatrate da ne bi trebao podnijeti ostavku?                             Jer mi je pomogao u proteklih dva mjeseca, odnosno mjesec dana, pronaći dodatnih 460 milijuna kuna za hrvatske poduzetnike. Je li to razlog za podnošenje ostavke?                             Dalo bi se razgovarati o tom pitanju. Očito nije odradio posao, a za nagradu je dobio novo ministarstvo.

He will return to Croatia tomorrow and all these questions you are as emphasized today and imputing some other ministers to ask Minister Pavic tomorrow. Why do you think you should not resign? Because it has helped me in the past two months or a month, to find an additional HRK 460 million for Croatian entrepreneurs. Is that a reason to resign? It would be talked about.

Možda jer je čitatelju nerazumljiva i teška pa je često zaobilazi na policama u knjižarama i knjižnicama. Možda zato jer ne postoji adekvatna promocija koja podržava sve oblike pisanja pjesama, a možda samo zato jer ljudi ne čitaju dovoljno. Što god bila istina, citirat ćemo što je autorica zbrike pjesama “Oda godinama” rekla o svojoj poeziji:                             “Svaki pjesnik se nada da će njegova pjesma biti primljena onako kako je pusti u dahu i pročitana ne samo očima čitatelja koji bivahu njegovom vjernom publikom, već i u očima onih koji kažu da ne razumiju poeziju. U očima onih koji su zaboravili da se u ovim stihovima kriju dijelovi nečije duše koja obojana životnim iskustvima uči, voli i nada se. Učeći o sebi, mi stvaramo iskustva u kojima se mnogi tako lako prepoznaju. I to jedan pjesnik umije staviti u stih, a svaki čovjek lako razumjeti.                             Moje su pjesme obojali razni trenuci, a ja sam nekada tužnija, a nekada sretnija bilježila one najsnažnije i vjerujem da ćete, ako otvorite srce, u njima prepoznati sebe.” Lea Brezar.                             Uz podršku Dvostruke Duge, izdavača koji je prošle godine objavio prvu knjigu autorice Lee Brezar, slikovnicu Crveni planet, na ovogodišnjem Interliberu predstavit će se njena zbirku pjesama “Oda godinama” čija će promocija biti u nedjelju, 15.11. 2015.

Maybe because she is incomprehensible and difficult for the reader, so she often bypasses her on shelves in bookstores and libraries. Maybe because there is no adequate promotion that supports all the forms of songwriting, and maybe just because people do not read enough. Whatever it is, we will quote what the author of the poems "ODA" said about her poetry: "Every poet hopes that his poem will be received as she was released in her breath and read not only to the eyes of the reader who were being his faithful audience, but also in the eyes of those who say they do not understand poetry. In the eyes of those who have forgotten that the parts of one's soul are hidden in these verses, who teaches, loves, and hopes. By learning about ourselves, we create experiences in which many are so easily recognized. And one poet can put it in verse, and every man easily understands. My songs have painted various moments, and I am sometimes sadder, and sometimes happier recorded the most powerful and I believe that if you open your heart, you will recognize yourself in them. ” Lea Brezar. With the support of a double debt, publisher who published the first book by author Lee Brezar last year, the Red Planet picture book, at this year's Interliber, will be presented by her collection of poems "ODA" whose promotion will be on Sunday, 15.11. 2015 at 3pm.

K tome kad se doda da se radi o emisiji na jednomu malenom radiju, kakav je Hrvatski radio Otočac, tada je to još impresivnija vijest.                             Tako se jučer namirilo 10 godina emitiranja emisije „Gackom zajedno“, emisije započete 2008. godine i emitirane u svaku nedjelju. To je bila i jest kontakt emisija, sa programom uživo, a teme, teme su bile različite, upravo onakve kakve ih život nameće, prije svega aktualne. I slušane. A u emisiji su sudjelovale različite strukture gostiju, od ministara, njihovih zamjenika ili pomoćnika, ravnatelja državnih uprava ili agencija, župana, gradonačelnika i načelnika, športskih, kulturnih, humanitarnih djelatnika, teško je i nabrojiti sve koji su sudjelovali.                             Ali to nije sve, kada se radi o broju te emisije, onda je jučer emitirana 500. emisija, u koju su pozvani gradonačelnici iz Ličko-senjske županije. Samo određene okolnosti dovele su do toga da nije bilo 520 emisija, „Gackom zajedno“ nije bilo samo onda kada su prenošene mise iz crkve Presvetog Trojstva, kada bi dan emitiranja pao na koji važni crkveni blagdan (Božić, Uskrs) ili državni praznik. No to ne umanjuje ovu veliku brojku emitiranja.                             A da bi se postigao kontinuitet, treba snage, upornosti i vjere u ono što se radi. Sve te karakteristike imala je i ima novinaraka Ruža Orešković, koja je pokrenula ovu emisiju. I sa svojim malenim timom u HRO-u ustrajala u tome, bez obzira na sve Scile i Haribde kroz koje je morala broditi. Svakako je ovaj jubilej na ponos ne samo gradu Otočcu, već i medijskoj široj javnosti.                             	290	10 years Gacko Together in 500 broadcast 1/1 Otočac - 10 years, 10 years is a significant period in every man's life, it's a good piece of life, and when it comes to 10 years of something else, like one radio show, then that's it the anniversary worth all attention. In addition to adding that it is a show on a small radio, such as Croatian Radio Otočac, then it is even more impressive news. So yesterday, 10 years of broadcasting "Gackom Together", the shows started in 2008 and aired on every Sunday, was hung up yesterday. It was and is the contact show, with a live program, and the topics, the topics were different, just the kind of life imposed on them, above all current. And listened. And various guest structures, from ministers, their deputies or assistants, director of state administrations or agencies, mayors, mayors and mayors, sports, cultural, humanitarian employees, participated in the show, it is difficult to list everyone who participated. But this is not all, when it comes to the number of that show, then the 500th show was broadcast yesterday, which was invited to the mayors from Lika-Senj County. Only certain circumstances led to the fact that there were no 520 shows, "Gackom together" was not only when masses from the Holy Trinity Church were transferred, when the day of broadcasting fell to which an important church holiday (Christmas, Easter) or a state holiday. However, this does not diminish this large broadcast number. And in order to achieve continuity, it takes strength, perseverance and faith in what is being done. All these characteristics were and has journalists Ruza Oreskovic, who launched this show. And with her little team at HRO persisted in this, regardless of all the scilly and the Haribde through which she had to ship. Certainly this jubilee is proud not only to the town of Otocac, but also to the media general public.

Obzirom da je cijena plina nedavno znatno poveæana, novi porast troškova za energiju, u uvjetima kada je usklaðivanje rasta mirovina zamrznuto, umirovljenici u Hrvatskoj ne bi mogli podnijeti. U medijima je najavljeno, i potvrðeno iz Hrvatske elektroprivrede, da se priprema zahtjev prema Vladi za novo poskupljenje struje s tim da se poène primjenjivati od 1. travnja ove godine. Nije potvrðeno koliki porast cijena æe tražiti, ali prema neslužbenim informacijama, to æe biti izmeðu sedam i deset posto. Matica upozorava da prosjeèna mirovina u Republici Hrvatskoj, isplaæena u sijeènju ove godine, po službenim podacima, iznosi svega 2.169,32 kuna. Prema analizama Matice, blizu 80 posto umirovljenika, njih 862.696, prima mirovinu koja je u prosjeku samo 1.709 kuna. Primjenom Zakona o posebnom porezu na plaæe i mirovine, takva razina mirovina ostat æe sve do polovice 2o11. godine, kada se oèekuje prvo sljedeæe usklaðivanje mirovina s rastom plaæa i potrošaèkih cijena. Posljedice „kriznog zakona“ stoga snose i najsiromašniji umirovljenici, a ne samo oni koji primaju mirovine veæe od 3.000 kuna. Matica umirovljenika Hrvatske zahtjeva da se u ovakvim uvjetima zamrznutog rasta mirovina, ne ide na poveæanje vitalnih cijena za umirovljenièku populaciju, u koje spada i cijena elektriène energije.

Talentirana glumica Anđela Ramljak razgovarala je s našom Mirjanom Brabec                             Stigla je na biciklu, u crvenom kaputu i s plavom beretkom, visoka, dugonoga, tanka, prekrasnog porculanskog tena, očiju plavih kao nebo tog toplog poslijepodneva potkraj veljače, kad smo se našle na suncem obasjanoj terasi mirnog dvorišnog kafića u Ilici. Anđela je nova Ofelija, uz Hamleta Franu Maškovića u kultnoj Shakespeareovoj tragediji, koju će ovog ljeta na Lovrijencu, na jubilarnim 70. Dubrovačkim igrama režirati uvijek provokativni Paolo Magelli.                             Često si na biciklu?                             – Uvijek, oduvijek. I u školu sam svaki dan išla biciklom s Bukovca kroz Maksimir, ne cestom. Možda sam upravo zbog toga toliko vezana uz šumu i prirodu. Lijepo mi je gledati kako se godišnja doba smjenjuju, volim promatrati šafrane u šumi, gole grane, snijeg...                             Jesi li se razveselila Ofeliji? Kako si doznala da si u Magellijevoj postavi?                             – Jako se tome veselim. Nazvao me Saša Božić, direktor Drame na Dubrovačkim igrama, i rekao: “Gdje si, draga? Ja sam u Berlinu, ali morao sam ti javiti – ovog ljeta igraš Ofeliju u Dubrovniku, a režira Paolo Magelli”. “Wow”, kriknula sam, baš se prolomilo. Jako volim i cijenim Paola i dramaturginju Željku Udovičić. Silno se veselim što ću ponovno s njima raditi i utjeloviti Ofeliju. Raduje me što je ekipa divna i što ću igrati na Lovrijencu, gdje još nisam igrala. Uz to, riječ je o jubilarnim sedamdesetim Igrama. Ima još vremena, ali lijepo je kad se možeš unaprijed veseliti projektu koji ćeš raditi i pomalo se u glavi za to pripremam. Ne volim unaprijed pripremati ulogu, imati sve zadano, volim kad je prvo “omirišem” i malo pomalo otkrivam, a onda se sve nekako složi kad počnem raditi s redateljem, dramaturgom, partnerom, kad se nađem u određenom prostoru...                             Novi Hamlet, Frano Mašković, u jednom je intervjuu rekao kako “Hamlet 21. stoljeća mora biti čovjek s problemom, a tek onda najpoznatiji Shakespeareov kraljević”, da se “Hamletovsko pitanje danas ne odnosi na život i smrt, nego na bivanje u osobnosti, moralu, odanosti, ljudskom integritetu i istini.” Kakvo je tvoje viđenje Ofelije?                             – Kao što sam rekla, ne želim još o tome razmišljati i unaprijed stvarati svoju viziju, bez redatelja, partnera, autorske ekipe. Želim da moja Ofelija nastane iz procesa rada na predstavi, kada zajedno iznesemo ideje na stol i počnemo ih u hodu uobličavati. Kako se i sama trenutačno nalazim u životnom razdoblju iz kojeg ću itekako moći crpiti inspiraciju za Ofi – već sam dobila taj nadimak – vjerujem da će proces biti pršteća eksplozija kreativnosti i strasti, kao što to uostalom uvijek biva s Paolom i Žeži (Udovičić op.a.), lomiteljima klišeja, majstorima netipičnog i nekonvencionalnog iščitavanja teksta.                             A kakve nam je još nekonvencionalne i netipične stvari o svojoj novoj ulozi otkrila Anđela, otkrijte u našem tiskanom izdanju za mjesec travanj na kioscima!                             	468	What did we learn about the charismatic actress to whom the cult director Paolo Magelli entrusted the role of offspring? Talented actress Anđela Ramljak talked to our Mirjana Brabec on a bicycle, in a red coat and a blue beret, tall, long, thin, beautiful porcelain complexion, eyes blue like the sky of that warm afternoon at the end of Feb a quiet backyard cafe in Ilica. Angela is the new offelia, with Hamlet Fran Maskovic in the cult Shakespeare's tragedy, which will be directed by the always provocative Paolo Magelli at the Jubilee 70th Games of Dubrovnik this summer. Are you often on a bike? - Always, always. And I went to school every day by bicycle from Bukovac through Maksimir, not by road. Maybe that's why I'm so attached to forest and nature. It's nice to watch the seasons change, I like to watch saffron in the woods, naked branches, snow ... Did you cheer off the offelia? How did you find out you were in Magelli's lineup? - I'm really looking forward to it. Sasa Bozic called me, director of the drama at the Dubrovnik Games, and said, “Where are you, dear? I am in Berlin, but I had to let you know - you play offija in Dubrovnik this summer and directs Paolo Magelli. " "Wow," I cried, it just broke. I really love and appreciate Paolo and playwright Zeljko Udovicic. I am very much looking forward to working with them again and embody Ophelia. I am glad that the team is wonderful and that I will play at Lovlac, where I have not yet played. In addition, it's a jubilee seventy games. There is still time, but it's nice when you can look forward to the project you will do in advance and I prepare a little in your head. I do not like to prepare the role in advance, to have everything default, I love when I "smell it" and discover a little bit, and then it all somehow agreed when I start working with a director, a playwright, a partner, when I find myself in a particular space ... New Hamlet, Frano Maskovic, in an interview, said that "the 21st century Hamlet must be a man with a problem, and only then the most famous Shakespeare Kraljevic", that "Hamlet's question is not related to life and death today, but to be in personality, morality, loyalty , human integrity and truth. ” What is your view of offspring? - As I said, I don't want to think about it yet and create my vision in advance, without director, partner, author teams. I want my offelia to emerge from the work process on the play, when together we bring ideas to the table and start to form them on the walk. As I am currently in the period of life, from which I will be able to draw inspiration for the OFA - I have already got that nickname - I believe that the process will be a pesting explosion of creativity and passion, as it always is with Paolo and Zeža (Udovičić Op. a.), cliché breaks, masters of atypical and unconventional reading of the text.

Na otvaranju izložbe u Matici prisutnima se, među kojima su, uz ljubitelje umjetnosti i goste, bili Katarina Hinić uime Državnog ureda za Hrvate izvan RH i Mišo Munivrana, tajnik saborskog odbora za Hrvate izvan RH, obratio Tomislav Žigmanov, ravnatelj Zavoda za kulturu vojvođanskih Hrvata, a o valorizaciji Vukovićeva djela i umjetničkih dosega govorila je povjesničarka umjetnosti Barbara Vujanović.                             Izložbu je otvorio ravnatelj HMI Marin Knezović. Obraćajući se prisutnima kazao je kako je ova izložba plakata Darka Vukovića vrlo bitna. Ona ukazuje na dio kulture Hrvata u Vojvodini koji se ne skriva od matice glavnih kulturnih tokova. Štoviše, autor je daleko od svake zatvorenosti i ograničenosti, sklon je dosjetci pa i provokaciji, no one nisu sama sebi svrha već dio jedne promišljene poruke i estetskog koncepta. Ova izložba bitna je, ne samo kao prikaz umjetničkog djelovanja jednog autora, nego i kao smjernica mogućeg djelovanja, jedne hrabrije i otvorenije politike prema kulturi Hrvata izvan Hrvatske. Izložbu je moderirala Marija Hećimović, voditeljica za hrvatske manjine HMI.                             Vuković važi za jednog od najzapaženijih mlađih grafičkih dizajnera u Srbiji, a njegovo se ime posebno vezuje za plakatni dizajn, „najumjetničkiju” od svih dizajnerskih formi. Dobitnik je više priznanja i nagrada: Prva nagrada UPIDIV-a na završnoj izložbi studenata Departmana likovnih umjetnosti Akademije umjetnosti iz oblasti grafičkog dizajna (1996.); Prva nagrada na natječaju za vizualni identitet „Forme 15′′ (1998.); Nagrada na IX. izložbi kazališnog plakata u okviru Sterijinog pozorja u konkurenciji plakata projekta (1998.); Specijalna nagrada Narodnog kazališta iz Užica za plakat predstave „Per Gint” (2000.); Prva i treća nagrada na X. izložbi kazališnog plakata u okviru Sterijinog pozorja u kategoriji plakata projekta, odnosno realiziranog plakata (2001.); Prva nagrada na natječaju Narodnog kazališta u Subotici za plakate predstava „Europejci” i „Totek” (2001.); Prva nagrada na XI. izložbi kazališnih plakata u okviru Sterijinog pozorja u konkurenciji realiziranih plakata (2004.); Prva nagrada na natječaju za vizualni identitet „Novosadskog Salona” (2007.).

Osim raznih fotografija koje simboliziraju ljubav, ponekad se među istima pronađu i one upućene direktno samoj Ivi, baš kao što je to bio slučaj i s jednom od posljednjih koja je zaintrigirala mnoge.

'Zato što si božanstveno srculence. Zagrljaj iz Beograda', stoji u rukom napisanoj poruci kojom se Iva pohvalila na spomenutoj društvenoj mreži. Iako nije otkrila tko je autor iste, s obzirom na to da je fotografijom iz Beograda, početkom ožujka ove godine, potvrdila da ponovno ljubi, nije izbačena mogućnost da je autor poruke upravo tajanstveni muškarac s kojim se tada držala za ruke u Knez Mihailovoj.                             Inače, nagađanja da je, nakon razvoda od Hrvoja Balenta s kojim je dobila troje djece, kći Taru te sinove Ivana i Antu, ponovno sretno zaljubljena, pojavila su se prošlog ljeta. Tada je snimljena na Visu u društvu mlađahnog muškarca za kojeg je kasnije tvrdila da joj je prijatelj. Međutim, za tog se muškarca pisalo da je iz Beograda, a isti neodoljivo nalikuje onome s kojim se držala za ruke u Beogradu.                             	216	Iva Todoric boasted a love message from Belgrade as part of an Instagram profile called 'Srculence', 44-year-old Iva Todoric, daughter of domestic tycoon Ivica Todoric, regularly shares photos of which, as she describes, full of a bank of love.

Možete li mi objasniti kako da odredim polarnost molekula? Znam da je pitanje ne kvalitetno no naprosto ne razumijem skoro ništa. Unaprijed hvala.                             O tomu što je polarnost ovdje se često piše, kao i metodama raspoznavanja polarnih od nepolarnih molekula. Ukratko, molekula je polarna ako joj je dipolni moment različit od nule. Dipolni moment molekule jednak je zbroju dipolnih momenata pojedinih veza u toj molekuli. Veze su to polarnije (tj. dipolni momenti su im to veći) što su povezani atomi različitijih elektronegativnosti. Kod simetričnih molekula koje imaju polarne veze (tetraklormetan, ugljikov dioksid) dipolni momenti se poništavaju pa su molekule nepolarne. Što je dipolni moment, možeš pročitati ovdje, a o polarnosti preporučam i ovaj odgovor, a posebno ovaj.

The fact that polarity is often written here, as well as the methods of recognizing polar from non -generous molecules. In short, the molecule is polar if its dipole moment is different from zero. The dipole moment of molecules is equal to the sum of the dipole moments of individual connections in that molecule. The connections are more polar (ie, the dipole moments are greater), which are connected by atoms of different electronegativity. For symmetrical molecules that have polar connections (tetrachloromety, carbon dioxide) dipole moments are canceled and molecules are undoubtedly.

Njemački profesor povuče kolegu Kineza za ruku vičući: “Lijepo vas molim da malo požurite!” Potrčali su i u posljednji čas ušli u autobus. Vrata su se zatvorila i autobus je krenuo. Nijemac je duboko odahnuo i pogledao na sat. “Bogu hvala, uštedjeli smo deset minuta.” Kinez ga je znatiželjno pogledao i smiješeći se upitao: “A što ćemo učiniti s tih deset minuta?”                             Nije toliko važno da budemo zaokupljeni poslom, koliko je važan sam razlog zaokupljenosti.                             	109	The earnings of a learned Chinese were invited to the University of Berlin.

Ukratko, radi se o kratkim dokumentarnim filmovima koji bi pokušali odgovoriti na pitanje - Kakav bi bio moj život da se nisam rodio u Belgiji, nego u nekom drugom dijelu svijeta?                             Za potrebe snimanja odabrana su 22 stanovnika Belgije (15 muškaraca i 7 žena), kojima se sada traže "blizanci" u različitim zemljama svijeta, a koji bi odgovorili na nekoliko pitanja o svojoj kulturi, navikama, iskustvima i načinu života u svojoj zemlji. Tako bi se, primjerice, napravili paralelni portreti ljudi rođenih istog dana, mjeseca i godine u drugim dijelovima svijeta - vatrogasca iz New Yorka, igrača kriketa iz Pakistana, bankara iz Koreje, trgovca iz Dubaia i slično.                             Jedna od zemalja u kojima se traže osobe voljne sudjelovati u projektu je i Hrvatska, jer smatraju da su naša povijest i kultura vrlo zanimljivi.                             Najveći problem je pronaći osobe koje su rođene istoga dana, istoga mjeseca i godine kao već izabrani Belgijci.                             Dakle, ako ste rođeni na jedan od ovih datuma ili pak poznajete bilo koga tko to jest (mama, baka, teta, stric, ujak, djed, prijatelj...), javite se.

For the purpose of recording, 22 inhabitants of Belgium (15 men and 7 women) were selected, who are now seeking "twins" in different countries of the world, who would answer a few questions about their culture, habits, experiences and lifestyle in their country. So, for example, they would make parallel portraits of people born on the same day, months and years in other parts of the world - a firefighter from New York, a Kriznik player from Pakistan, a banker from Korea, a dealer from Dubai and the like. One of the countries in which persons are being willing to participate in the project is Croatia, because they believe that our history and culture are very interesting. The biggest problem is to find people born on the same day, the same month and year as already elected Belgians.

I don't know what I did by writing that I don't know how to do it otherwise but I guess it should ??

HTC je danas i službeno skinuo prilično prozirni veo misterije sa svojega prvog phableta pod nazivom HTC One Max. Više ne moramo ništa nagađati i pogađati. Sve se zna.                             HTC One Max treći je član ovogodišnje HTC One obitelji, a k tome i najveći. Sa zaslonom dijagonale 5.9 inča nalazi se negdje između Samsungova Galaxya Note 3 i Sonyeve Xperie Z Ultra. Zaslon je Super LCD3 i ima full HD razučivost što na tu dijagonalu daje oko 374 ppi, dakle i više no dovoljno za uživanje u surfanju webom, multimediji i granju. Pokretan je četverojezgrenim Snapdragonom 600 takta 1.7 GHz, baš kao i HTC One, a 2 GB RAM-a pripomažu da sve bude glatko. U ponudi će biti modeli s 16 GB i 32 GB interne memorije.                             Iako svojim dizajnom jako želi sličiti HTC-u One, više zapravo podsjeća na uvećani HTC One mini. Opet ima dosta razlika. Prva i osnovna je senzor otiska prsta na leđima, a druga je i stražnji poklopac koji se skida i otvara put ka utorima uza micro SIM karticu ali i microSD karticu, kojom je internu memoriju moguće proširiti za dodatnih 64 GB. Tamo otraga je i ista ona 4 MP UltraPixel kamera, poznata s HTC-a One. Tamo na leđima nema više Beats Audio loga pa se da zaključiti da ta tehnologije nije integrirana.                             Sprijeda su isti oni BoomSound zvučnici, jedan iznad, a drugi ispod zaslona gdje su opet dvije umjesto tri Android tipke s HTC logom. Radi bolje ergonomije, Power tipka se s vrha uređaja preselila na desni brid tik ispod tipki kontrole glasnoće, dok je gore ostao IR blaster za funkcionalnosti univerzalnog daljinskog upravljača.                             Inače vrti Android 4.3 i ponešto osvježeni HTC Sense 5.5.                             Gabariti su mu pozamašni, a detaljne mjere glase: 164.5 x 82.5 x 10.29 mm i 217 g.                             Na tržište u Velikoj Britaniji stiže već sutra pa će onda i u ostatak svijeta, a valjda i k nama premda još nemamo službenih informacija.                             Koliko HTC One Max može pomoći HTC-u da opet krene uzlazno, upitno je. Bude li imao dobru cijenu, interesa bi moglo biti.                             Sve se znalo I prije,nikakva novost.Zašto se u članku ne prikazuju slova s dijakritičkim znakovima?                             0                             Reply                             vepar                             Nema IPS ekran,slabiji hardver nego na Note3,dimenzije i masu ne treba ni komentirat.jos kad opale neku bijesnu cijenu nije ni cudo sto ce propast...                             	394	HTC One Max officially introduced - prepare big paws not that it comes to us as a surprise, but it still makes us happy. HTC has officially removed the rather translucent veil of mystery from its first phablet called HTC One Max. We no longer have to speculate and guess anything. Everything is known. HTC One Max is the third member of this year's HTC One family, and the biggest. With a 5.9 -inch diagonal screen, it is somewhere between the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Sonye Xperie z ultra. The screen is a super LCD3 and has a full HD, the wickedness that gives about 374 PPI in that diagonal, so enough to enjoy surfing the web, multimedia and branch. It is moving with a quad-core Snapdragon 600 tact of 1.7 GHz, just like HTC One, and 2 GB of RAM annexes that everything is smooth. There will be models with 16GB and 32GB of internal storage. Although it very much wants to resemble HTC One with its design, it is more of a reminder of the enlarged HTC One Mini. There are a lot of differences again. The first and basic is a fingerprint sensor on the back, and the second is the rear cover that is removed and opening the way to the slots with a micro SIM card as well as a microSD card, which can be expanded by an internal memory by an additional 64GB. There, the same is the same 4 MP UltraPixel camera, known from HTC One. There is no more beats audio logo on the back, so it is not possible to conclude that these technologies are not integrated. The front are the same those boomsound speakers, one above and the other below the screen where two are again two instead of three Android keys with a HTC logo. For the sake of better ergonomics, the Power button moved from the top of the device to the right brid under the volume control button, while the IR Blaster remained above for the functionality of the universal remote control.

Narod je, imajući u vidu strogu vojnu upravu, živio po vojnim pravilima i načelima vjere, pa je javnih grješnika bilo veoma malo. Ako ih je i bilo, vojne su ih vlasti strogo kažnjavale. Kažnjavalo se za razne postupke: svađu, ogovaranje, ometanje tuđega bračnog života, krađu, šumske štete, skitnju, izbjegavanje mise i vjeronauka, rad nedjeljom i blagdanom, nerad i drugo. Vojne su vlasti kažnjavale batinama, trčanjem kroz šibe, zatvorom, prisilnim radom, a za najteže prijestupe i smrću. Psovke i bogohulstvo bile su naročito zabranjene i kažnjavane. Za pogrdne i sramne činove nije bio kažnjen samo počinitelj, već i onaj koji ga u tome činu nije spriječio. Podčasnici su sve nadgledali: muškarce, žene i djecu. Kazne su javno čitane i izvršavane uz nazočnost mještana, obično ispred zgrade kapetanije. Tu se nalazila stalno postavljena klupa za batinanje s okovima, ili se iznesla iz kapetanije prije izvršenja kazne. Kažnjavalo se batinama ljeskovim štapom (15 – 25 batina po debelom mesu), a ako je došlo do opetovanog prekršaja, slijedio je zatvor. Batinao je za to određeni časnik a pri pukovnijskom sudu posebni batinaš (Stockmeister).                             	202	Batina as a measure of punishment in the Military Frontier Military Krajina government took care of public order and peace, and together with the Church and the Morality.

If there were, the military authorities were strictly punished. It was punished for various actions: quarrels, gossip, interfering with someone else's married life, theft, forest damage, siding, avoiding mass and religious instruction, work on Sundays and holidays, reluctance and more. The military authorities were punished by beating, running through the wicked, prison, forced work, and for the most severe pre -existence and death. Curses and blasphemy were particularly forbidden and punished. Not only the perpetrator was punished for derogatory and shameful ranks, but also the one who did not prevent him in this act. The underpass was overseen by men, men, women and children. The penalties were publicly read and executed with the presence of the locals, usually in front of the captaincy building. There was a permanent bench for beating with shackles, or leaving the captaincy before the sentence executed. The beating of the hazel rod (15 - 25 beats per thick meat) was punished, and if a repeated offense occurred, prison followed.

Malo nas vodi računa na kakvom ležaju spavamo, kreveti koje koristimo nerjetko su stari nekoliko desetaka godina, a slično je i sa madracima. Dobar krevet, dobra podnica i dobar madraci najbitniji su djelovi vaše spavaće sobe, jer oni osiguravaju pravilnu anatomsku potporu vašem tjelu i pomažu vam da se ujutro probudite odmoreni i naspavani, spremni za novi dan.                             Prilikom kupnje kreveta predlažemo da svakako razmislite o krevetu koji je izrađen od masivnog punog drveta, jer takvi kreveti znatno su dugoročniji i nikada neće škripati ukoliko su pravilno izrađeni i sastavljeni. Na takvom krevetu možete po potrebi izmjeniti madrac, dok to ne možete napraviti na nekim tapeciranim popularno nazvanim "francuskim krevetima"                             Kada je riječ o madracima treba uzeti u obzir široku lepezu proizvoda koji će zadovoljiti svaki položaj tjela i stupanj tvrdoće i udobnosti. Ovisno kako spavate madrace možete birati po položaju tjela u kojem spavate ili pak po tvrdoći. Debljina madraca također ima bitnu ulogu u tome kakvu će potporu tjelu madrac pružati, a kao najbitniju stavku izdvojili bismo materijal i način izvedbe madraca.

Ovu listu sam odlučila napraviti iz razloga što mi se zna dogoditi da zaboravim na neki proizvod pa kupim neki slični, a nema smisla imati dva slična ili proizvoda s istim učinkom. Na ovaj popis gledam više kao putokaz, nešto da ne zalutam te me baš zanima koliko ću proizvoda skinuti s liste u godinu dana.                             Zvijezda ovog posta je Essence nadlak iz kolekcije holo graphics lakova s holo efektom. Baza ovog laka je prozirna, a u njemu se nalazi puno sitnih čestica koje se presijavaju s svim bojama. Lak ima tipičnu Essence širu četkicu pomoću koje se može lijepo nanijeti na nokat i ono što mi se sviđa je to da se brzo suši. Nosila sam ga na raznim lakovima, a da bi vidjeli koliko je lijep pokazat ću vam u nekoliko kombinacija, a njegova puna ljepota se dobije na suncu, odnosno kada je sunčan dan.                             Danas sam imala u planu natipkati jedan drugi post, no u razgovoru s mojom sestrom odlučila sam se za jednu wish listu. To nije WL proizvoda koji su mi tiha patnja, kao ni proizvoda koji nisu dostupni u našim trgovinama, nego jedna mala kozmetička lista želja proizvoda koje bi u skorije vrijeme htjela nabaviti, a koje se koriste svakodnevno. Moja mama i sestra muku muče što mi kupiti za Božić, a željele bi mi uz glavni dar uzeti neku sitnicu od kozmetike, a opet da ja ne znam što je to pa da se iznenadim, a da mi se sviđa. Kako sam ja kozmetički freak, ne usude se uzeti nešto na svoju ruku, a nisu tipovi koji bi za jednu paletu sjenila izdvojile nekoliko stotina kuna. Tako sam došla na ideju da napravim ovu malo drugačiju kozmetičku listu :)                             U ožujku se još uvijek držim onoga da ću kupovati samo ono što mi nužno treba. Tako je i bilo. Moj new in za ovaj mjesec se možda neće činiti malim zbog goodie baga sponzora Avon Beauty Blog Daya 2014. koji su stvarno bili divni i kojima zahvaljujem i ovom prilikom, a kako nam je bilo na BBD-u možete pročitati ovdje.                             Već sam se hvalila kako sam na Avon Beauty Blog Dayu (o kojem sam pisala OVDJE) bila jedna od pet sretnica koja je osvojila koferčić sa šest Essie lakića za nokte iz najnovije proljetne kolekcije. Kolekcija sadrži četiri pastelna i dva jarka laka.                             Danas ću vam pokazati prvi lak iz te kolekcije Hide & go chic. Riječ je o azurno plavom laku koji se meni kao obožavateljici plave boje odmah svidio.                             	439	I am not a person from the list, especially not a list of desires, not because I do not want anything, but in most cases where I want something to buy it. I decided to make this list for the reason that I can forget about a product, so I buy some similar ones, and there is no point in having two similar or products with the same effect. I look at this list more as a signpost, something not to stray and I wonder how much product I will take off the list in a year. The star of this post is the Essence Nadlak from the Holo Graphics varnish collection with a holo effect. The base of this varnish is transparent, and there are many small particles that are pressed with all the colors. The varnish has a typical Essence wider brush that can be nicely applied to the nail and what I like is that it dries quickly. I wore it on various varnishes, and to see how beautiful it is, I will show you in several combinations, and its full beauty is obtained in the sun, that is, when it is a sunny day. Today I planned to type another post, but in talking to my sister, I decided on a Wish list. It is not WL products that are quiet suffering, as well as products that are not available in our stores, but a small cosmetic list of products of products that would soon be wanted to obtain, which are used daily. My mom and sister are struggling to buy me for Christmas, and with the main gift they would take some little things from cosmetics, and yet I don't know what it is so I am surprised to like it. As I am a cosmetic freak, they do not dare to take something on their own, and they are not guys who would set aside several hundred kunas for one shadow palette. So I came up with the idea of ​​making this slightly different cosmetic list :) In March, I still stick to what I will buy only what I need. And it was like that. My new in this month may not seem small for the Goodie Baga Sponsor Avon Beauty Blog Day 2014, which were really wonderful and thank you on this occasion, and you can read here on the BBD here. I was already bragging about that I was one of five lucky women on Avon Beauty Blog Day (I wrote about here) that won the Koferčić with six Essie nail polish from the latest spring collection. The collection contains four pastel and two vibrant varnish. Today I will show you the first polish from that Hide & Go Chic collection. It is an azure blue light that liked me immediately as a fan of blue.	Opinion/Argumentation		I am not a person from the list, especially not a list of desires, not because I do not want anything, but in most cases where I want something to buy it.I decided to make this list for the reason that I can forget about a product, so I buy some similar ones, and there is no point in having two similar or products with the same effect.I look at this list more as a signpost, something not to stray and I wonder how much product I will take off the list in a year.  The star of this post is the Essence Nadlak from the Holo Graphics varnish collection with a holo effect.The base of this varnish is transparent, and there are many small particles that are pressed with all the colors.The varnish has a typical Essence wider brush that can be nicely applied to the nail and what I like is that it dries quickly.I wore it on various varnishes, and to see how beautiful it is, I will show you in several combinations, and its full beauty is obtained in the sun, that is, when it is a sunny day.  Today I planned to type another post, but in talking to my sister, I decided on a Wish list.It is not WL products that are quiet suffering, as well as products that are not available in our stores, but a small cosmetic list of products of products that would soon be wanted to obtain, which are used daily.My mom and sister are struggling to buy me for Christmas, and with the main gift they would take some little things from cosmetics, and yet I don't know what it is so I am surprised to like it.As I am a cosmetic freak, they do not dare to take something on their own, and they are not guys who would set aside several hundred kunas for one shadow palette.So I came up with the idea of making this slightly different cosmetic list :)  In March, I still stick to that I will only buy what I need.And it was like that.My new in this month may not seem small for the Goodie Baga Sponsor Avon Beauty Blog Day 2014, which were really wonderful and thank you on this occasion, and you can read here on the BBD here.

Što tek reći za svetog Augustina: on i jest živio kao Hef pa se onda toga odrekao. Besmisleno... Ali ako već jest kasno za Franu i Tina, nije za nas. Ne gubimo vrijeme...                             Upravo bih ovakva zamucivanja htio izbjeci. Dakle, jedno je kad Papa kurtoazno primi sal za koji se uspostavi da je u duginim bojama, a sasvim nesto drugo kad Papa na redovitoj opcoj audijenciji kaze bez ikakvih ograda nesto poput ovog gore.                             Naravno da neće svi u raj (papa govori o Crkvi koja ide k Novom Jeruzalemu, Raju). Ti Toma sasvim sigurno nećeš u raj. Koliko si se nalagao o papi i ispljuvao Kristovu Zaručnicu može samo sluga Sotone.                             Ovo "tutti" je naravno mislio svi oni koji ce ici u raj. Recenicu zapravo potpuno prirodno treba citati: Svi [koji ne zavrse u paklu, nego u raju] ćemo se naći tamo gore, svi [koji ne zavrse u paklu, nego u raju].                             Dobro ste primjetili da i u doba novog milosrdja ima onih koji nece u raj. To su oni koji su zatvoreni za novosti koje donosi duh ili izvlace jednu ili dvije ili stotinu Papinih izjava i cina iz "konteksta".                             Točno je da Papa nije rekao da baš svi idu u raj. Marko je dobro primjetio za Tomu, ali ako bolje poslušamo snimku, lijepo se čuje što je papa stvarno rekao i koga je sve spomenuo: Tutti noi ci troveremo lassù, tutti, meno Mons Lefebvre e Hitler (forse) e Toma Blizanac da Croazia. E’ bello, dà forza all’anima.                             Toma, učiti talijanski, a ne čitati sedevakantističke i slične stranice.                             Marko, Mario ili kako se vec sad zovete, mozda biste vi mogli otvoriti stranicu na kojoj biste nam davali ispravne interpretacije Papinih izjava. U medjuvremenu ne morate vise visiti ovdje.                             Također da ne bi bilo zabune tj. da netko stvarno ne pomisli da je naš papa zatražio „blagoslov“ od nekakvog šizmatika. http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2014/11/never-before-seen-francis-bows-his-head.html                             Naime razlog je sasvim drugi. Papa Franjo je probao u maniri izbacivača iz disko kluba, što je već sam priznao da je u mladosti bio, čelom razbiti nos Bartolomeju. Sama izjava Bartomeleja o tome kako ga je taj papin čin doslovno zateknuo, govori ovome u prilog. Na žalost ili na sreću, pozne godine našeg pape, učinile su svoje, te je papa dobrano promašio. Na kraju je taj čin ispao osim smiješan i vrlo neugodan za papu. Bartolomej se dobro snašao i izbjegao taj udarac, ali poljupcem u čelo dao do znanja da se papa neće izvući i da će osveta uslijediti. Mislim da u predstojećem vremenu svi moramo pojačano moliti za papinu sigurnost , kao i ne zaletati se u preranim zaključcima i komentarima papinih gesti i govora.                             Predlazem meditaciju "Passive scandal" koju mozete naci na ovim stranicama: http://www.sensustraditionis.org/multimedia.html. Inace su sve meditacije jako dobre, ali ova je bas prigodna za temu iz posta.                             Otvorio sam neke govore. Glas mi je identičan s onim jednog propovjednika iz youtube kanala "Video Sancto", ako ti je poznato.                             Bok Toma, mislim da je ovo ono sto trazis.

What to say about St. Augustine: He lived as Hef and then renounced it. Meaningless ... but if it's too late for Fran and Tina, it's not for us. We don't waste our time ... I just would like to avoid this kind of turbidity. So, one thing is when the pope turns down the sal for which it is established in rainbow colors, and something else when the pope on a regular general audience says something like this above. Of course not everyone will go to heaven (the pope talks about the Church that goes to New Jerusalem, paradise). You certainly won't go to heaven. How much did you seek about the pope and spit out the fiancée of Christ only a servant of Satan. This "Tutti", of course, thought all those who would go to heaven. The sentence is actually completely natural to read: all [who do not end in hell, but in paradise] we will find ourselves up there, all [who do not end in hell but in paradise]. You have noticed well that even in the time of new mercy, there are those who will not go to heaven. These are those closed to the news that brings the spirit or draws one or two or two or a hundred of the Pope's statements and the act from the "context". It is true that the Pope did not say that everyone was going to heaven. Marko noticed well for that, but if we better listen to the recording, it is nice to hear that the Pope really said and who he mentioned: Tutti noi ci slam Lassù, Tutti, Mons Mons Lefebvre e Hitler (Forsse) e Toma Gemini da Croazia. E 'Bello, dà forza all'ani. Thomas, learn Italian, not read the sedevakantic and similar pages. Marko, Mario, or as you are already called now, maybe you could open a page where you would give us the correct interpretations of the Pope's statement. In the meantime, you don't have to hang here anymore. Also, it would not be confused, that is, if someone really did not think that our Pope had asked for a "blessing" from some kind of schismatics. http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2014/11/never-before-seen-francis-bows-his-head.html, the reason is quite different. Pope Francis tried in the manner of an ejector from the disco club, which he himself admitted to being a young age, to break the nose of Bartolome. Bartomele's statement itself about how that Pope's act literally made it, says this in support. Unfortunately or fortunately, the late years of our Pope, did their own, and the Pope missed well. In the end, the act turned out except funny and very unpleasant to the pope. Bartolomej managed well and avoided that blow, but by kissing the forehead, let him know that the Pope would not get out and that revenge would follow. I think in the upcoming time we all have to pray for the pope's safety, as well as not to rush in the premature conclusions and comments of the Pope's gestures and speech. The proposal of "Passive Scandal" meditation you can find on these pages: http://www.sensustradijionius.org/multimedia.html. Otherwise, all meditations are very good, but this one is just like the topic from fasting. I opened some speeches. My voice is identical to that one preacher from the YouTube channel "Video Sancto", if you know. Hi Thomas, I think this is what you are looking for.

Zahvaljujemo na interesu i prisustvovanju našoj prezentaciji «Analize rezultata istraživanja čarter tržišta Njemačke za 2005.», u kojoj smo značajno mjesto posvetili Hrvatsko – Slovenskom segmentu. Odgovaramo na Vaš iskazan interes za sažetkom prezentacije, kao što smo obećali.                             PREDSTAVLJANJE Da podsjetimo one koji već znaju i da se ukratko predstavimo onima koji nas još dovoljno ne poznaju. Godine 2002.-e, u «Marinpol-u», našem Marketing programu, globalno smo odredili sadržaj naše krilatice: «Yacht-Pool više od osiguranja». Tada smo naime zacrtali da je naša vizija da osiguramo osjećaj zadovoljstva, bezbrižnosti i zaštićenosti vlasnicima i korisnicima plovila za sport i razonodu i da uz pomoć tog nastojanja s našim klijentima uspostavimo partnerski odnos. Također smo osmislili da je naša misija u užem obuhvatu: promicanje djelatnosti usluga osiguranja plovila za sport i razonodu u Hrvatskoj. U širem obuhvatu, mi nastojimo na dodavanju vrijednosti» našem osnovnom poslu putem: uvođenja, širenja i pružanja pecijaliziranih znanja u jahtingu i to prije svega na području kvalitete upravljanja poslovanjem i okolišem. U tom smislu obraćamo se svojim proizvodima prije svega čarter tvrtkama i agencijama, vlasnicima jahti i flota, brodskim i motornim servisima, ponuđačima brodova, leasing kućama, marinama i svim ostalim karikama nautičkog lanca.                             STRATEGIJA TRŽIŠNOG PRISTUPA YACHT-POOL-a Od tada pa do danas, organizirali smo više skupova u obliku prezentacija, seminara i workshop-ova i to na velik broj intrigantnih nautičkih tema: od sigurnosti na moru, odgovornosti u čarteru, do rigging-a, suvremenih odrednica kvalitete i gradnji i servisiranju brodova. Redovito surađujemo brojnim nautičkim časopisima, a za članove i partnere naše udruge izdajemo i vlastitu „Yacht-Pool reviju“. Također smo već tri godine za redom održali veoma uspješan Yacht-Pool-ov Dan prijateljstva u Poreču. Eto, takvim aktivnostima i sadržajima neprestano nastojimo da spomenuti slogan „više od osiguranja“ ima stvaran, koristan, upotrebljiv, ali i ugodan sadržaj. Završavajući s predstavljanjem onog što radimo, recimo nekoliko riječi o nama koji to radimo.                             Kompčetnu prezentaciju i materijal sa seminara možete preuzeti ovdje: Analiza Njemačkog čarter tržišta.                             	330	Summary of the presentation on the analysis of the results of the research of the charter market of Germany's introduction to the Introduction we warmly welcome you after another Yacht-Pool socializing.

We have also designed that our mission is in a narrow coverage: promoting the activities of the Sports and Reneason Services Services Services in Croatia.

5976	CLASSLA-web.hr.583878	http://free-zg.htnet.hr/Nikola_Pejkovic/predgovor.html	free-zg.htnet.hr	Opinion/Argumentation	Nije dovoljno imati samo fotoaparat s filmom u ruci, šetati prirodom i «okidati» kada nam se nešto učini posebnim! Kada razvijemo film i izradimo slike uočimo da bi viđeni motiv snimljen možda iz «žablje» ili «ptičje» perspektive, te uz naš pomak ili pogledom par koraka desno ili lijevo bio zapravo onaj pravi i očekivani detalj, ali eto to nije realizirano u času našeg pritiska na okidač fotoaparata! Nezadovoljni učinjenim fotografije odlažemo i počinjemo tražiti dalje nešto bolje u našem slijedećem posjetu prirodi. No kada čovjek snimajući želi «dokumentirati» viđeni trenutak nekog prizora, tada mora imati i «ugrađen» osjećaj, da njegovo nastojanje ne postane samo manualan čin volje i želje – već ipak i nešto više od toga! Taj osjećaj čovjek ima ili nema, može vremenom postići ili samo gleda ali ne «vidi» ono što bi zapravo trebao doživjeti i vidjeti pri susretu s onim što je privuklo pažnju njegova oka i objektiva fotoaparata.                             Druga činjenica koja također nije često presudna je činjenica o starosti autora i o vrsti fotoaparata kojim se on koristi! U našem slučaju radi se o mladom autoru, ali o autoru koji zaista ispravno «gleda» oko sebe kroz objektiv svog fotoaparata a ima i osjećaj dobro opaziti i osjetiti nešto što nije niti obična «razglednica» niti «goli» dokument, koji je trebalo samo registrirati – već svojoj slici »udahnjuje dušu» i čini da ona bude onakva kakovu je i osjetio u času viđenja.                             Uz pravilnu ekspoziciju vode što žubori u «Vilinim kosama», u «Snu u pjeni» i u «Žuboru» mi svojim osjetilima zapravo i čujemo taj žubor, jer «Ledena čarolija» nije samo čarolija za autora već i čarolija za nas koji to promatramo na odabranoj fotografiji. Bijelo perce ptice i u snijegu zarobljen vrh osušenog lista te «Ledeni ukras» i toliko poznati detalj nazvan «Mali raj» sa Plitvičkih jezera, zaista su potvrda da autor ima već dobro «ugrađen» smisao za suptilno osjećanje onog što je vidio i zapazio. Potvrda toga svakako je «Ledena pila» koju je – našavši ju – trebalo i registrirati s potrebnom dozom osjećaja i zakona fotografskog zanata.                             Očito da je mladi autor točno pogodio ono što je želio, kao što je u snimljenim odrazima pravilno odredio granicu između svjetlosti refleksa oblaka ili neba tamom obale i koso nagnutim granama stabala što vire iz vode. «Čarobno drvo» u tom refleksu, kao i «Paukova mreža» postali su ono što nam je autor htio dočarati, a s «Odrazom lica» i motivom «Pronađi me» očito je najsugestivnije pokazao svoj pravi odraz i očito se pronašao u svom traženju pravog puta u fotografskoj umjetnosti kao osobnom opredjeljenju nadahnjujući sebe samoga, ali i nas kojima je sve to pokazao ovom svojom prvom izložbom.                             Vjerujem da će Nikola Pejković vrlo brzo postati osoba čije će snimke ukrašavati dvorane mnogih izložbi, a zasluženo dobivene nagrade biti će potvrda onog što sam osobno uspio «pročitati» iz ove njegove fotografske poruke «zapisane» na emulziji filma i na slojevima njegovih kolor fotografija.                             	483	It's not enough to have a camera with a movie in your hand, walk nature and "trigger" when something is done to us special! When we develop a movie and make pictures, we notice that a seen motif shot maybe from a "frog" or "bird" perspective, and with our shift or a couple of steps to the right or left was the real and expected detail, but this was not realized at our time Pressure on the camera trigger! Dissatisfied with the photos done and we start looking for something better in our next visit to nature. But when a man is filming, he wants to "document" the moment of a scene seen, then he has to have a "built -in" feeling that his efforts become just a manual act of will and desire - but still more than that! This sense of man has or does not have, he can achieve or just watch over time, but he does not "see" what he should actually experience and see when meeting what attracted the attention of his eye and the camera lens. Another fact that is also not often crucial is the fact of the age of the author and the type of camera he uses! In our case, this is a young author, but about the author who really "looks" around him through the lens of his camera and has a feeling good to notice and feel something that is neither an ordinary "postcard" or a "naked" document, which only needed to register - already to his image "inhales the soul" and makes it the way he felt at the time of seeing. With the proper exposure of water that the Žubori in "fairy hair", in the "dream in the foam" and in the "Žubor" we actually hear that Žubor, because the "ice magic" is not only a magic for the author but also the magic for us who observe this selected photo. White perce birds and in the snow captured the top of the dried leaf and the "ice decoration" and a so well -known detail called "Little Rhine" from Plitvice Lakes, are really a confirmation that the author has a already well -built "sense of subtle sense of what he saw and noticed. Confirmation of this is certainly a "icy saw" that - finding it - needed to register with the necessary dose of feelings and law of photographic crafts. Obviously, the young author struck exactly what he wanted, as in the recorded reflections he properly determined the limit between the light of cloud reflexes or the sky in the coast and the sloping branches of trees peeking out of the water. The "Magic Wood" in this reflex, as well as the "spider network", became what the author wanted to conjure us up, and with the "reflection of the face" and the motive ", find me", obviously showed his true reflection and obviously found himself in his search Road in photographic art as a personal commitment, inspiring himself, but also of us to whom he showed it all with his first exhibition. I believe that Nikola Pejkovic will quickly become a person whose recordings will decorate the halls of many exhibitions, and the well -deserved awards will be a certificate of what I personally managed to "read" from this photographic message "written" on the film emulsion and at the layers of his photographs.

Сестринската линија од реномираниот италијански бренд Валентино, "Ред Валентино", веќе го објави лукбукот за колекцијата што ги најавува трендовите за следната година. Па така, ќе посведочите на нè толку инвентивни парчиња, кои во себе содржат инспирација од морнарските мотиви и училишните денови. Ретро моментот е проткаен низ сите парчиња, но на модернистички начин кој некако се поврзува со новото време.                             Според Валентино, никогаш не е доста од морнарските пруги, точките и цветните принтови. Колекцијата се движи во рамките на дневните комбинации сочинети од фустанчиња со ретро изглед споени со сандали и чорапи, тука се и кратките здолништа, транспарентните кошули, мото јакните со пруги, мантилите и панталоните со должина над глужд кои диретно не навраќаат наназад низ времето.                             Очигледно е дека оваа колекција ќе ги освои девојките што од својот стил преферираат женствен и романтичен изглед кој на уникатен начин се издвојува од комерционалноста.                             	173	Red Valentino predicts a storm of prints for next summer Although we are already feeling the autumn, the fashion industry sends us a completely different energy transformed through the presentation of the 2015 last-summer collections. The sister line of the renowned Italian brand Valentino, "Red Valentino", has already announced the Lukbuk for the collection announcing the trends for next year. So you will testify to us so many inventive pieces that they contain inspiration from navy motives and school days. The retro moment is imbued through all the pieces, but in a modernist way that somehow connects to the new age. According to Valentino, it is never enough of the sailor railroads, points and flower prints.

Со цел да го забрзаат процесот на запознавање и спријателување, психолозите составиле листа од 5 прашања што можат да ви ги откријат најважните карактеристики за личноста пред вас. На тој начин уште веднаш ќе дознаете дали сте компатибилни и дали има можност да започне цврсто пријателство.                             1. "Како би се опишал/а себеси?"                             Ова прашање може да изгледа многу едноставно, но начинот на кој ќе го одговорите открива многу за личноста. Таа ќе треба да се опише самата себеси, да зборува за себе, за својата работа, за семејството, пријателите и за сите останати нешто што ги смета за важни во животот. Вие ќе ги дознаете нејзините приоритети.                             Ова прашање ќе го открие минатото на личноста. Тоа што таа го смета за успех и начинот на кој ги поставува своите цели во животот е клучна информација за вас. Ова достигнување може да биде што било, професионално, академско, личност, спортско...                             3. "Дали некогаш си прочитал/а добра книга?"                             Ова прашање ќе ги раздвои луѓето што читаат од оние што не читаат, а тоа многу кажува за одредена личност. Исто така ќе дознаете каков вид книги сакаат или не сакаат, а тоа ќе ви даде идеја и за оние нешта што им се допаѓаат или не им се допаѓаат во вистинскиот живот.                             Ова прашање има многу потенцијал за откривање на креативноста на личноста. Со одговорот ќе дознаете дали тој или таа има креативна и забавна страна. Обрнете внимание и на тоа колку брзо треба да одговори, така ќе знаете дали досега размислувал/а на оваа тема или не. Исто така ќе дознаете и што работи сега, и дали е среќен/среќна или несреќен/несреќна во својата област.                             5. "Кој е твојот личен херој?"                             Обожувањето на хероите воопшто не е невообичаено. Ова прашање ќе ви ги открие нивните вредности и начинот на кој самите сакаат да станат подобра личност. Без разлика дали станува збор за член на семејството, спортска ѕвезда, славна личност или автор. Ова е одлична прилика да дознаете сè за вредностите на личноста со која сега сте се запознале.                             	335	Getting to know new people can be a challenge, but also an exciting experience. In order to speed up the process of dating and befriend, psychologists have compiled a list of 5 questions that can reveal to you the most important personality features in front of you. That way you will immediately find out if you are compatible and whether there is a chance to start a solid friendship. 1. "How would you describe yourself?" This question may seem very simple, but the way you answer it reveals a lot about the person. She will have to describe herself, talking about herself, about her work, family, friends, and all the others that considers them important in life. You will find out her priorities. This question will reveal a person's past. What she considers success and the way she sets her goals in life is a key information for you. This achievement can be whatever, professional, academic, personality, sports ... 3. "Have you ever read a good book?" This question will separate people who read from those who do not read, and that tells a lot about a particular person. You will also find out what kind of books they want or do not want, and that will give you an idea for those things they like or dislike in real life. This issue has a lot of potential for detecting personality creativity. The answer will find out whether he or she has a creative and entertaining side. Notice how fast you need to answer, so you will know if you have been thinking about this topic or not. You will also find out what is doing now, and whether he is happy/happy or unhappy/unhappy in his field. 5. "What is your personal hero?" The worship of heroes is not uncommon at all. This question will reveal their values ​​and the way they want to become a better person themselves. Whether it's a family member, a sports star, a celebrity or author. This is a great opportunity to find out about the values ​​of the person you have now met.

Иако самата објава може да се толкува дека оди во насока на зголемување на безбедноста во сообраќајот, таа, пред сè, е вест чија конструкција и наслов се единствено направени за повеќе кликови, т.е. клик-бејт информација.                             Нашето пребарување на интернет покажа дека слични информации, со иста фотографија се објавувани неколку години наназад, најчесто на приватни блогови, профили од социјални мрежи и по некој медиум. Само еднаш била објавена на два сајта на медиум во земјава, а тоа било во 2018 година на сајтот на Македонија денес, кој денес не постои и истата година на сајтот на Мотика, каде што уште може да се види.                             Најстарата објава на интернет што можеше да се најде е објавена во 2016 година на американскиот агрегатор на социјални мрежи Реддит. Од април 2016 на оваа мрежа биле забележани уште 9 објави со идентичната фотографија.                             Оттогаш, повторување на оваа фотографија може да се види на повеќе сајтови, блогови и мрежи низ целиот свет секоја календарска година, а сите објави можете да ги видите на оваа адреса на пребарувачот на фотографии ТинАј.                             Според фактите што ги имаме, може да се оцени дека објавата е без контекст. Не може да се потврди дека настанот се случил некаде во Северна Македонија, а со оглед дека е објавена на Прилеп денес, не може да се тврди и дека е на подрачјето на Прилеп. А, објавата со првата фотографија, двајца сообраќајни полицајци со ознаки на МВР, асоцира дека се случила некаде во земјата.                             	398	The photo of a child glued to a speeder is old and is not from the country Posting on the Facebook page of Prilep today manipulates the public with text and photography related to traffic safety.

Имено, овој исклучително необјективен напис се повикува на некакви "статистички податоци", но, не кажува прецизно за какви податоци се работи и од каде се добиени. Ама затоа, уште на самиот почеток од текстот прави спинерска конструкција и тврди дека:                             "...вчерашниот протест организиран од опозициските структури не е ништо повеќе туку обид од семејните трагедии на луѓето кои загинале во сообраќајќи, СДСМ да си обезбеди предност во предизборната трка",                             иако беше соопштено дека мирниот протест беше организиран од Граѓанската иницијатива "Коце, врати ни ги улиците", во знак на револт за големиот број жртви на скопските улици. На булеварот Илинденска, на местото каде пред десетина дена загина 13-годишно момче, граѓаните протестираа со легнати велосипеди, а градоначалникот Коце Трајановски го посочија како "најодговорен за тоа што пешаците и велосипедистите сè почесто страдаат во сообраќајни незгоди".                             Меѓутоа, во овој наменски текст, жртвите на пешачките премини на скопските улици се маргинализирани, речиси невидливи. Во него без трошка срам нагласено се фали градоначалникот за "проширување на клучните сообраќајници и изградба на катни гаражи", додека одговорноста за трагедиите на пешачките премини се колективизира. И, во таа спасувачка мисија, на помош се повикуваат "виртуелни" сообраќајни експерти, кои треба да ги убедат гледачите дека поради "подобрената сообраќајна инфраструктура":                             "Бројот на несреќи со жртви опаѓа...!"                             "ОПАЃАЛЕ ЖРТВИТЕ"!                             Наспроти имагинарната слика што ја креира овој материјал, последните анализи на Републичкиот совет за безбедност во сообраќајот на патиштата (РСБСП) покажуваат дека е зголемен е бројот на загинати пешаци во Скопје во однос на минатата година. Повикувајќи се на податоци од РСБСП, агенцијата "Мета" деновиве објави дека:                             "Во апсолутни бројки, за првите шест месеци во 2015 година имаше 20 загинати, за разлика од лани, кога имало 15. Најголемиот дел од загинатите се пешаци. Во првите осум месеци, пак, земајќи ги и јули и август, од вкупно 27 загинати во Скопје, дури 15 се пешаци."                             Потегот, пак, на еден сервилен начин да се брани нешто што едноставно не може да се одбрани, па уште на крајот да се заклучи дека:                             е целосно непрофесионален, неетички и изгледа невкусно, недостоинствено, очајно лошо!                             	329	Falcades without shame!

Многу од овие несакани појави можат да се избегнат со употребување на затворена амплитудна јамка (amplitude-lock loop - ALL).                             	96	With increasing radio traffic density and the use of increasing frequencies as information carriers, some basic problems for AM and FM transmission are becoming more pronounced. Above all, the demodulation of the am signals is getting worse with the weakening of the holder. Not to mention cases when it is completely lost (Feding). When it comes to FM, the demodulated signal becomes very distorted, when we have two signals with a similar amplitude and the same or similar frequency. Many of these unwanted phenomena can be avoided by using a closed amplitude loop (Amplite -Lock Loop - All).

Она што е заедничко и за двете дами, освен нивната природна убавина, грижа за својот изглед и самоувереност е и нивната дружба со Philips Lumea.                             Со цел да ги видиме нивните впечатоци и ефикасноста на уредот, им поставивме неколку прашања за нивните рутини и методи за отстранување на несаканите влакна од телото, п.е.л (пред ерата на Lumea :)), но и за резултатите по само 3 третмани.                             Антонија: За првпат пред неколку месеци, чинам беше на социјалните медиуми, кога за првпат уредот ми го привлече вниманието. А пак физички и во живо го запознав кога мојата најдобра другарка ја купи и почна се фали.                             Ангела: Преку сајтовите на кои девојки споделуваа искуства. Само од далеку. Но, сега се радувам што денес и јас сум една од нив. Онаа која зборува и го споделува позитивното искуство од користењето на Lumea.                             Антонија: Голема возбуда, но искрено и малку недоверба дека баш тој апарат може да ми обезбеди такви резултати.                             Ангела: Убава на изглед, мала и компактна, а може да ги реши секојдневните проблеми на една жена или девојка.                             Антонија: Колку сакам секој ден во годината да е лето.                             Ангела: Одлично, идеален уред за мазна кожа во домашни услови.                             Антонија: Особено внимание посветувам на грижата за себе и своето тело. И во секојдневието, но                             и заради професијата, важно ми е секогаш да изгледам одлично пред камера. Па, како најпрактичен метод (како и повеќето од нас, нели) користев брич. Тоа што највеќе ми пречеше е дека влакната растат повторно за само 2-3 дена.                             Ангела: Депилација со восок, каде што за разлика од Lumea, болката е неспоредлива, а барањето слободен термин кој ви одговара некогаш е луксуз.                             5. Која зона ја третирате?                             Ангела: Во сите области на кои Lumea се користи. Раце, нозе, бикини зона, пазуви, надусници... ја користам максимално.                             6. По колку третмани забележавте резултати?                             Антонија: На секој предел различно, на некои и после првиот, но на повеќето после вториот третман.                             Ангела: После вториот третман влакната почнаа да се изретчуваат, а со секој нов третман, резултатите беа сè повидливи.                             7. Дали боли?                             Антонија: Јас искрено имам висок праг на толеранција на болка, но Lumea-та во ниеден момент не ми претставуваше проблем. Третманите се сосема безболни, во споредба со сите други начини на отстранување на несаканите влакна.                             Ангела: Не би ја нарекла болка, тоа е едно минимално пецкање и чувство на топлина, само на одредени места.                             8. Во која зона забележавте најмногу резултати?                             Антонија: Стомакот и нозете.                             Ангела: Пазувите. Она што беше некогаш секојдневно бричење, сега се сведе на безболни третмани со одличен резултат.                             Антонија: Инвестирањето во Лумеа е една од најпаметните одлуки кои можете да ги направите. Ви ветувам дека инвестицијата е мала во споредба со трајните резултати.                             Ангела: Топло ја препорачувам. Искористете ги актуелните поволности и набавете ја уште сега, и подгответе се уште сега за во летото да уживате во мазната кожа.                             	461	Antonia Lokvenec and Angela Gjorgieva are two beautiful girls, especially active on the social network Instagram.

Antonia: For the first time a few months ago, I was on social media, when the device first caught my attention. And I met him physically and live when my best friend bought her and began bragging. Angela: Through the sites on which girls shared experiences. Just from afar. But now I am glad that today I am one of them. The one that speaks and shares the positive experience of using Lumea.

Angela: Beautiful in appearance, small and compact, and can solve the everyday problems of a woman or girl. Antonia: How much I want every day to be summer. Angela: Great, ideal device for smooth skin at home. Antonia: I pay particular attention to caring for myself and my body. Both in everyday life, but also because of the profession, it is important for me to always look great in front of the camera. Well, as the most practical method (like most of us, right) I used a razor. What the most bothered me is that the hairs grow again in just 2-3 days. Angela: Wax waxing, where unlike Lumea, the pain is unmatched, and the free term that suits you is sometimes a luxury. 5. Which zone do you treat? Angela: In all areas where Lumea is used. Hands, legs, bikini zone, armpits, tilters ... I use it maximally. 6. How many treatments did you notice results? Antonia: On each area different, some after the first, but the most after the second treatment. Angela: After the second treatment the fibers began to be pronounced, and with each new treatment, the results were more visible. 7. Does it hurt? Antonia: I sincerely have a high threshold of pain tolerance, but Lumea has never been a problem for me. Treatments are completely painless, compared to all other ways of removing unwanted fibers. Angela: I wouldn't call it pain, it's a minimal tingling and a feeling of warmth, only in certain places. 8. In which zone did you notice the most results? Antonia: stomach and legs. Angela: The underarms. What was once daily shaving is now reduced to painless treatments with excellent results. Antonia: Investing in Lumea is one of the smartest decisions you can make. I promise you that the investment is small compared to the lasting results. Angela: I warmly recommend it. Take advantage of the current benefits and get it now, and get ready now to enjoy the smooth skin in the summer.

(дечко/девојка) Затоа родителите се плашат да им земат куче за после да не остане нивна обврска.                             ^Па кога тинејџер ќе порасне,ќе има над 20тина години,па неверувам да на 20 години трчаш по девојки,веќе си возрасна и зрела личност за да кучето го исфрлиш на улица.А кога мало дете ќе прерасне во тинејџер,тогаш ќе има 12-13 години.И нормално дека од десет годишно дете неможеш да очекуваш да се грижи за едно куче.Тогаш родителите,би требало да се свесни за реалноста.И јас сум ветувала на десет години дека ќе се грижам за се,ама никогаш не сум успевала.Да речеме настине кучето,најобична настинка и десет годишно дете ќе го носи кучето на ветеринар?Јас досега не сум сретнала некој тинејџет да го исфрле кучето на улица зошто е старо. Сум видела да тинејџери,се фураат пред девојките најчесто со питбули по улиците и ги носат на борби као демек гледај јас што сум го научил кучето и мислат дека тоа е забавно и ,,кул,, А нив да ги остават да се тепаат,не ќе е лошо. За овие молби, да не бидеш свесен дека секое куче ги посакува,треба да бидеш безчуствителен. Најмногу од се ме иритира напуштањето на кучињата кога се во зрелост или пак кога се болни. И удирањето(особено она непотребното),ако си имал стресен ден,кучето не е воопшто виновно за тоа,па наместо да го изнатепаш безпотребно,провери дали е се во ред со твојот мозок.                             Јас никогаш не би го направила тоа на моето куче! Сум се истестирала на кучето на чичко ми и сега сум сигурна дека можам да се снајдам сама за едно мало куче. Мене тестот ми беше малку потежок зошто кучето беше поголемко и понемирно па се влечевме... Но, сепак знам да се снајдам за едно куче со мал раст. :up:                             На кучево мое никогаш во животов лошо не сум му направила.

Се разбира, добро заварување не можеме да постигнеме без квалитетна електрода за заварување. Но која електрода да ја избереме, како, да откриеме дали продавачот ни ја продал електродата која ни е потребна, како доколку некој од комшиите ни подари пакетче електроди, ќе знаеме дали ќе можеме да го искористиме со нашиот уред за заварување? Следниов текст ќе даде одговор на овие прашања, т.е какви типови електроди постојат, нивната примена, карактеристики и начин на обележување.                             Во Емитер бр. 3/10 беше објаснета рел-постапката на заварување, а во овој натпис ќе ги објасниме главните карактеристики и обележувањето на електродите. Имено, секоја електрода се состои од јадро на електродата и облога на електродата. Улогата на јадрото на електродата е да овозможи воспоставување и одржување на електричниот лак помеѓу металот и електродата и со своето растопување да обезбеди дополнителен материјал на заварената врска. Од овде доаѓа првиот услов за избор на електродата, т.е. јадрото на електродата треба да има состав кој има карактеристики (механички и хемиски) еднакви или подобри од основниот материјал (деловите кои се заваруваат).                             	204	The widespread distribution of the relief and frequent application of this procedure at home and small workshops leads us to a situation where we need to weld two or more components into one whole. Of course, good welding cannot be achieved without a quality welding electrode. But what electrode to choose, how, to find out if the seller has sold the electrode we need, as if one of the neighbors gave us a package of electrodes, we will know if we can use it with our welding device? The following text will answer these questions, ie what types of electrodes exist, their application, characteristics and manner of marking. In EMITER no. 3/10 The relation of welding was explained, and in this inscription we will explain the main features and marking of the electrodes. Namely, each electrode consists of the core of the electrode and the coating of the electrode. The role of the core of the electrode is to allow the establishment and maintenance of the electric arc between the metal and the electrode and to provide additional material to the welded connection. From here comes the first condition for electrode selection, ie. The core of the electrode should have a composition that has characteristics (mechanical and chemical) equal or better than the basic material (welded parts).

Пред време да не ја свиткуваме главата, зашто тоа не би помогнало или да го намали злото, кое може да не сполети. Така ние си ја зголемуваме маката и ја правиме поголема отколку што е всушност.                             Ве молам сестри да не Го навредувате Бога со нашата слаба вера и надеж во Него!

15197	CLASSLA-web.mk.18600	https://radar.mk/?p=29847	radar.mk	Information/Explanation	Топењето на мразот е посебен феномен од 21-от век, а примерите од замрзнатите површини кои исчезнуваат се многу чести.                             Научниците известуваат дека топењето на мразот влијае на животната средина, па така објавиле дека со топењето на мразот може да дојде и до емисија на закопаните зрачења.                             Меѓународниот тим до сега проучувал 17 ледени локации ширум светот, вклучувајќи ги и оние на Арктикот, Антарктикот, Исланд, Алпите, Кавказ и Британска Колумбија. Трагови на природна радијација постојат, но научниците бараа примери на зрачења кои ги предизвикал човекот.                             "Тоа се некои од најголемите нивоа на радијација надвор од нуклеарната зона"- вели Каролин Класон од универзитетот Плимут.                             Радијацијата, која предизвикана од човечката рака, како оние во нуклеарната катастрофа во Чернобил 1986-та година, несреќате во Фукушима 2011-та година, заминува во атмосферата.                             Тука има низа од радиоактивни елементи, како радиоактивен цезиум, заради кој луѓето се разболуваат, па дури и умираат.                             Потоа чернобилските радиоактивни облаци патуваа низ Европа, без оглед на границите. Носени од дождот, честичките стигнаа и до Велика Британија. Со смрзнување на дождот настанува мраз, во кој што честичките остануваат заробени.                             "Радиоактивните честици се многу лесни па по пат на атмосферата можат да се транспортираат до некои далечни дестинации. Дождот испарува, но снегот останува замрзнат со децении, а при топење навлегува и во тлото"- вели Класонова.                             Во Шведска во 2017-та година пронајдена е радијација која е 10 пати поголема од нормалното ниво.                             Остатоците од радијација не се гледаат само после нуклеарните катастрофи туку и после употреба на нуклеарно оружје.                             Радиоактивните елементи имаат различни животни векови.                             Плутониумот-241 може да "живее" 14 години, додека пак синтетичкиот хемиски елемент америциум 241 има животен век од 423 години. Во мразот можат да останат многу долго, а се шират при топење.                             	269	Melting ice is a special 21st century phenomenon, and examples of frozen-disappearing areas are very common. Scientists report that melting ice affects the environment, so they have reported that melting ice can also show a buried radiation. The international team has so far studied 17 icebergs around the world, including those in the Arctic, Antarctica, Iceland, the Alps, the Caucasus and British Columbia. There are traces of natural radiation, but scientists have been looking for examples of radiation caused by man. "These are some of the largest levels of radiation outside the nuclear zone," said Carolyn Classon of Pomouth University. Radiation, caused by the human hand, such as those in the 1986 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, is leaving for the atmosphere. There is a series of radioactive elements, such as radioactive cesium, which people get sick and even die. Then Chernobyl radioactive clouds traveled across Europe, regardless of borders. Wearing the rain, the particles also reached the UK. With freezing of the rain, frost occurs, in which the particles remain trapped. "Radioactive particles are very lightweight so the atmosphere can be transported to some distant destinations. The rain evaporates, but the snow remains frozen for decades, and in the melting," Clasonova said. In Sweden in 2017, radiation was found 10 times the normal level. Reminer radiation is not only seen after nuclear disasters but also after the use of nuclear weapons. Radioactive elements have different life centuries. The plutonium-241 can "live" for 14 years, while the synthetic chemical element of America 241 has a life expectancy of 423 years. The ice can stay very long and spread when melting.

Издавачите Bethesda им ветија на фановите вртоглав шутер кој спојува самостоен, ко-оп и мултиплеер гејмплеј во едно беспрекорно искуство. Многумина очекуваа забележително револуционизирање на мрежните пресметки и нивна имплементираност во оригинален и модерен дизајн, но она што девелоперите Splash Damage испорачаа во 2011 година беше сосема просечен шутер. Играта до некаде ги импресионира критичарите, кои, пак, возвратија со Metascore оценка од 70 поени, но поголемиот број од гејмерите одбиваат по вторпат да ја погледнат и немаа ништо против кога времето ја голтна со изненадувачки интензитет.                             Од Bethesda сметаат дека Brink заслужува уште една шанса и ја направија целата игра бесплатна за играње. Без какви било ограничувања, можете да го преземете насловот и да видите дали, по шест години ферментација, конечно е достоен да го окупира вашето внимание. Оние кои сакаат да ја наградат иницијативата, а и да ја прошират забавата би можеле да купат некое од двете помали додатоци, од по 1 евро, или пак да го купат, третиот, поголем додаток, за неполни 2 евра.

Последните наследници на еден вид политички новоговор во кој некоја држава би можела да добие име кованица Југo+Славија, можеби и не е чудно, се: Македонија и Косово*.                             Македонија во светот сè уште и официјално се нарекува Бивша Југословенска Република Македонија, БЈРМ. Фуснотата во името постои во различни документи од евроатлантската интеграција: во нив пишува дека Грција, за разлика од Турција – не ја признава под "скратеното" име.                             Доколку имаа браќата Македонци смисла за хумор како и за историја, ќе го патентираа тоа име и никогаш не би се откажале од него. Што има поубаво од тоа татковината и мајчината, родната земја да се нарекува "Бивша..."?                             Неволјата е што во конкуренцијата за југословенското фуснотско наследство пред некој ден се појави уште еден натпреварувач, Косово*.                             Воислав Коштуница смета дека тоа значи признавање од страна на српската власт дека на територијата на Србија постои држава со ѕвездичка, Косово*. Американскиот амбасадор во Приштина тврди дека фуснотата на името Косово* во регионалните иницијативи е безначајна, бидејќи вистинскиот суверенитет не се постигнува со симболи, туку само со негово остварување. Точно знаеме што им значи тоа на Американците.                             Астерикс – треба да се разликува од Астерикс и Обеликс – е типографски знак (*) за напомена во текстот кој Германците го нарекуваат фус – а Англоамериканците футноут, во она исто српско разликување на фузбалот од фудбалот, или фусбал од футбал, ако сме јазично најточни.                             Фуснотата објаснува или упатува на изворот и објаснувањето на поимот искористен во текстот, содржи цитат или референца за делот од текстот покрај кој е поставена. Српскиот јазик наводно има збор подбелешка со истото значење. Ако фуснотата го објаснува зборот во реченицата, знакот * или некој друг се поставува над зборот, а доколку се објаснува цела реченица, тогаш знакот се поставува на крајот на реченицата.                             Косово* се чита вака: " овој назив без прејудицирање на статусот на Косово е во согласност со Резулуцијата 1244 и одлуката на Меѓународниот суд на правдата за косовската декларација за независност". А значи...                             Зависи кој чита и во кој новоговор. Како и ова:                             * Во согласност со Бело дугме и онаа позната Плукни и запеј...                             radio.spodeli.org                             	350	The footnote lived, you live and live, if not in memories and songs, then surely in the footnote. The last heirs of a kind of political new conversation in which a state could get a name coin South+Slavia, maybe not strange, are Macedonia and Kosovo*.

А како што често се случува, домот не е местото, туку луѓето што го сочинуваат. По смртта на нејзините родители, таа се враќа во Словачка, каде што живее со својот партнер и работи како медицинска сестра. Описите на нејзиното секојдневје се проникнати со сеќавањата за мајчината смрт, сопоставувајќи го нејзиното здодевно постоење со екстремноста на извесни ситуации. Семејните врски се главната тема на романот – стари и нови, тесно поврзани и далечни – како и нивното значење и бесмисленост. "Слики од животот на М." дава фасцинантен приказ на современиот живот во Виена и Братислава, кои во романот се претвораат во универзален симбол на современиот урбан европски живот и на предизвиците што им ги наметнуваат на младите.

Украсете ги вашите свеќници со добродетели. Борете се да ги отфрлите страстите. Исчистете го вашето срце од секоја нечистотија и чувајте го чисто за да дојде и да се всели во вас Господ; да ве исполни Светиот Дух со Своите Божествени дарови.                             Деца мои љубени, целиот ваш труд и грижи да бидат насочени таму. Тоа да биде ваша незапирлива цел и стремеж. Кон тоа да биде насочена вашата молитва.                             Секојдневно барајте Го Господ; но внатре, во вашето срце, а не некаде надвор од него. И кога ќе Го најдете, станете со страв и трепет како херувимите и серафимите, бидејќи вашето срце станало Божји престол. Но, за да Го најдете Господ, смирете се целосно, зашто Господ се гнаси од гордите, а ги љуби и посетува оние со смирено срце. Затоа и вели: "Но на кого ќе погледнам? На оној кој е со смирен дух и кој трепери од Моите зборови".                             Бори се во духовната борба и Бог ќе те направи силен. Во борбата се сретнуваме со нашите слабости, недостатоци и грешки. Борбата е огледало на нашата духовна состојба. Кој не се борел, не се запознал самиот себеси. Внимавајте дури и на малите грешки. Ако од невнимание паднете во грев, не губете надеж, туку бргу станете и молете Му се на Господ, Кој има моќ да ве подигне. Претераната тага крие гордост во себе. Таа и безнадежноста се штетни и опасни, и често се преувеличуваат од страна на ѓаволот за да се прекине напредокот на оној кој се бори. Во себе имаме слабост, страсти и мани, длабоко вкоренети. Сето тоа не може да се надмине со коленичење, со помош на слабоста и големата тага, туку со трпение и истрајност, храброст, труд и внимателност. Патот кој води кон совршенството е долг. Молете Го Бога да ве направи силни. Со трпение да ги надминувате вашите падови, и штом брзо ќе станете, да итате а не да стоите како деца на местото каде што сте паднале, плачејќи и липајќи без утеха.                             Бдејте и молете се да не паднете во зло. Не очајувајте ако често паѓате во старите гревови. Многу од нив се јаки по природа и по навика. Меѓутоа, со тек на време и со трудољубивост, се победуваат. Ништо нека не ве фрла во безнадежност.                             	398	Word of Spiritual Struggle (27.06.2012) Fasting, vigil and prayer themselves do not bring the desired fruits, because they are not the purpose of our lives; They are means of achieving the goal. Decorate your candles with virtues. Fight to reject passions. Clean your heart from every dirt and keep it purely to come and move to you the Lord; to fill you with the Holy Spirit with His Divine Gifts. My loved ones, all of your work and worries to be directed there. To be your unstoppable purpose and aspiration. Towards being targeted your prayer. Look for the Lord daily; But inside, in your heart, not somewhere outside of it. And when you find it, become fear and trembling like the cherubim and seraphs, because your heart has become God's throne. But to find the Lord, calm down completely, for the Lord is disgusted by the proud, and loves and visits those with a humble heart. That is why she says, "But who I will look at? To the one who is in a humble spirit and who trembles my words." Fight in the spiritual struggle and God will make you strong. In the fight we find our weaknesses, disadvantages and mistakes. The struggle is a mirror of our spiritual state. Who did not fight himself did not meet himself. Be careful even on small mistakes. If you fall into sin by carelessness, you do not lose hope, but quickly become and pray to the Lord, who has the power to raise you. Excessive sadness hides pride in itself. It and hopelessness are harmful and dangerous, and are often exaggerated by the devil to end the progress of the fight. We have weakness, passions and flaws, deeply rooted. All this cannot be overcome by knee, with the help of weakness and great sadness, but with patience and endurance, courage, labor and vigilance. The road that leads to perfection is long. Pray God to make you strong. With patience to surpass your falls, and as soon as you get up quickly, rush and not stand like children where you have fallen, crying and linding without comfort. Watch and pray not to fall into evil. Do not despair if you often fall into old sins. Many of them are strong by nature and habit. However, over time and with diligence, they are defeated. Let us throw nothing in hopelessness.

Во периоди на настинки и грипови се препорачува внес на храна богата со антиоксиданти како свежо овошје и зеленчук.                             Антивоспалителни својства имаат намирници како темно-зелен зеленчук, бобинки, лосос, домат, а пожелни се и намирници богати со витамин Ц како калинки, лимони, портокали, мандарини, магдонос, пиперки, зелка, праз и слично.                             Истражувањата покажале дека цинкот, кој го има во семки од тиква, спанаќ, остриги, јаткасти и мешункасти плодови, може да го скрати траењето на настинката дури за неколку дена.                             Пробиотици – стражари на организмот                             Микробите кои живеат во нашиот дигестивен систем ни помагаат да ја свариме храната, но и учествуваат во регулирањето на нашиот метаболизам, чувството на глад и телесната тежина, а имаат и влијание врз имунитетот.                             Силниот имунитет е резултат на здрав дигестивен тракт, а во неговата беспрекорна работа помагаат пробиотиците кои содржат добри бактерии кои ефикасно ги ублажуваат воспаленијата и спречуваат инфекции.                             Вежбајте, спијте и проветрувајте                             За ојачување на имунитетот важна е грижата за телото и редовно вежбање. Но никако не го жртвувајте спиењето бидејќи квалитетното спиење е клучно во борбата против настинки и грип. Во период на вируси, задолжително проветрувајте ги просториите каде што спиете.                             	194	The type and quality of the groceries we eat is very important to magnify immunity.

Денеска сакаме да објавиме повелба за граѓаните за Македонија. Тоа е документ кој од денеска го нудиме јавно на увид на сите оние што се заинтересирани, на сите граѓанки и граѓани, на сите политички партии, невладини организации, здруженија на граѓани, групи, експерти, поединци, религиозни и етнички здруженија. Буквално до секој човек кој живее во оваа наша земја, ако сака, ако смета дека е сега моментот да се приклучи, да го направи тоа затоа што нашата цел со овој документ е да дадеме поддршка на концептот на граѓанска Македонија и да се обединиме во натпартиска коалиција, општонародна натпартиска коалиција која ќе ги испорача своите барања на 17-ти мај кога е закажан големиот општо народен протест пред Владата на Република Македонија.                             Оние кои тоа сакаат да го направат можат да го направат и со потпишување на тој документ. Оние кои сакаат на поинаков начин, во поинаква форма тоа да го сторат, да дадат поддршка на оваа иницијатива можат да го направат тоа.                             Во секој случај за нас најважно е што е можно поширок круг на луѓе, надвор од опозиционата коалиција којашто ги организира формално овие протести д се приклучат и да кажат дека се против начинот на кој досегашната полициско партиска врхушка ја раководи Република Македонија.                             Ќе почнеме со активностите на таа натпартиска граѓанска коалиција на 17-ти мај и ќе продолжиме да протестираме се до падот на оваа Влада и до формирањето на преодна влада која ќе треба да заврши неколку работи кои јавно ги имаме и досега кажувано, а ги има и во оваа повелба за којашто реков од денеска ќе биде на увид на целокупната македонска јавност.                             Оваа коалиција која денеска ја промовираме нема да биде на трајни основи, нема да трае вечно туку ќе трае до формирањето на преодна влада.                             Ја користам оваа прилика да ги повикам сите оние кои сметаат дека оваа власт не владее демократски, дека масовно ги крши човековите слободи и права да се приклучат.                             Основната работа во оваа повелба е дека не станува збор за битка за власт на две политички партии туку станува збор за битка на целиот слободоумен народ, на сите слободоумни граѓани наспроти неколкумина луѓе во врвот на најголемата партија во власта.                             	371	Formed Formed Civic Coalition Statement for Media Stevo Pendarovski, Pillar Partnerships for Democratic Macedonia Skopje, 08.05.2015.

Каква е таа реторика што, гледам, провејува и во дел од прилозите на странските медиуми? Кога тоа станал диктатор, а кога бил реформатор? Кратковидоста, опортунизмот, корумпираноста и колаборационизмот на дел од опозицијата и граѓанскиот сектор, како и молкот и одобрувањето на меѓународната заедница се причини што на Груевски се гледа како на реформатор кој прераснал во диктатор. Погрешно, многу погрешно.                             Груевски секако не беше во позиција да биде диктатор кога му беше потрчко на Љубчо Георгиевски кога беше негов министер за финансии. Немаше ништо реформаторско во криминалната продажба на Рафинеријата Окта од која се инкасираа само 32 милиони евра, а се верува дека дури половината од тие пари отишле во приватни џебови.                             Продажбата на Македонска банка, меѓу првите аудио записи за кои дознавме, нема реформаторски, туку криминални елементи.                             Националната платежна картичка е уште еден коруптивен скандал "пред" тој да стане диктатор. Овој "проект" на Груевски своевремено го критикува и Михајло Маневски кој подоцна станува првиот егзекутор на македонското правосудство и негов верен послушник, заслужено наречен министер за неправда.                             Немаше ништо реформаторско ни во неговото напредување кон лидерската позиција во ВМРО-ДПМНЕ која Љубчо Георгиевски му ја подари во 2003. Според партиски извори, Груевски го сметале за будалетинка која Љубчо ќе може лесно да ја контролира. Тоа е една матна, гангстерска приказна која кулминира во пролетните месеци во хотел Панорама. Тогаш, власта во партијата Груевски ја бранеше со цевки во појасите на неговите приврзаници, наспроти приврзаниците на неговиот творец Љубчо. Против него тогаш беше и Љубе, а и "уметникот" Тони Опуштениот.                             Не можел да биде диктатор тогаш, но секако го сметале за будалетинка. И погрешиле. Тој имал јасна цел, а неговата политичко-криминална конституција никогаш не ветувала ништо добро.                             radio.spodeli.org                             	285	From a fool to dictator Gruevski was a reformer when he came to power and then became a dictator? What is the rhetoric that, I see, also in some of the foreign media reports? When did it become a dictator, and when was a reformer? The shortsight, opportunism, corruption and collaboration of part of the opposition and the civil sector, as well as the silence and approval of the international community, are the reason for Gruevski to be seen as a reformer who has grown into a dictator. Wrong, very wrong. Gruevski was certainly not in a position to be a dictator when he was leaning for Ljubco Georgievski when he was his finance minister. There was nothing reformed in the criminal sale of the OKTA refinery, which collected only 32 million euros, and it is believed that even half of that money went to private pockets. The sale of Makedonska Banka, among the first audio records we found out, has no reformer but criminal elements. The national payment card is another corrupt scandal "before" he becomes a dictator. Gruevski's "project" also criticized Mihajlo Manevski, who later became the first executioner of the Macedonian judiciary and his faithful obedient, deservedly called the Minister of Injustice. There was nothing reformed in his advancement to the leadership position in VMRO-DPMNE that Ljubco Georgievski donated to him in 2003. According to party sources, Gruevski considered him a fool that Ljubco could easily control. It is a blurry, gangster story that culminates in the spring months at the Panorama Hotel. Then, Gruevski's government defended the pipes in the belts of his supporters, as opposed to supporters of his creator Ljubco. Ljube was against him, and "artist" Tony relaxed. He could not be a dictator then, but certainly considered him a fool. And they were wrong. He had a clear goal, and his political-criminal constitution never promised anything good. radio.spodeli.org	Opinion/Argumentation	Or News	From a fool to a dictator  Gruevski was a reformer when he came to power and then became a dictator?What is the rhetoric that, I see, also in some of the foreign media reports?When did it become a dictator, and when was a reformer?The shortsight, opportunism, corruption and collaboration of part of the opposition and the civil sector, as well as the silence and approval of the international community, are the reason for Gruevski to be seen as a reformer who has grown into a dictator.Wrong, very wrong.

А Америка има право да врши терор врз друга држава па дури и да ја бомбардира??? Како можеш да велиш дека едни имаат, а други немаат... Кој и го дал правото на Америка да врши терор по целиот свет ??? Па уште и ти тоа да го одобруваш... А нема само Русија и Америка ќе си отиде како помочана од балканот исто како од Виетнам...                             Русија кон Грузија се однесува како колонијален силеџија Лондон, 2 мај (МИА) - Русија кон својот сосед Грузија се однесува како "колонијален силеџија", пишува "Индепендент" во својот редакциски коментар за најновата криза околу оваа кавкаска држава, јави дописникот на МИА од Лондон. Весникот наведува дека таквото однесување на Москва, за кое тврди дека наликува на она од времето на поранешниот Советски Сојуз, е последица на однесувањето на Западот, кого "Индепендент" го обвинува за блокирањето на приближувањето на Грузија кон НАТО, што беше направено на последниот самит на Алијансата. - Русија добро знае дека западните земји нема да потрчаат за да им пружат помош на Грузијците во нивниот судир со големиот и моќен сосед, па затоа така и се однесуваат, констатира лондонскиот весник. Затегнатоста меѓу Русија и Грузија трае уште од таканаречената "револуција на розите" во 2003 година, кога властите во Тбилиси наместо тесното сојузништво со Москва, решија за прв пат да се свртат кон Западот. - Таа кризна ситуација деновиве добива на драматика, околу областите Абхазија и Јужна Осетија кои најавуваат отцепување од Грузија, за што се широко подржувани и потикнувани од Русија, наведува "Индепендент". Според овој лондонски весник, дипломатскиот пораз на Москва околу косовската независност, ја огорчи Русија која сега настојува да докаже дека тоа што важи за Косово може да се применува и за овие две грузиски области во кои повеќето од луѓето зборуваат руски јазик. Грузија затоа одби да му се приклучи на европскиот консензус околу Косово и да ја призне независноста на новата балканска држава и понуди федеративно уредување на земјата, со значително зголемување на правата за Абхазија. Таквата понуда локалните власти во Сухуми ја отфрлија, инсистирајќи на целосна незвисност, иако се вели дека се повеќе стравуваат дека би можеле да бидат анектирани од Русија. За грузиската криза, денеска во Лондон, треба да се сретнат и да разговараат американскиот државен секретар Кондолиза Рајс и рускиот министер за надворешни работи Сергеј Лавров.

"Russia knows well that Western countries will not run to help Georgians in their clashes with their big and powerful neighbor, so they behave, so the London newspaper said. The tightness between Russia and Georgia has been going on since the so -called "Roses Revolution" in 2003, when authorities in Tbilisi instead of the close alliance with Moscow decided to turn to the West for the first time. "That crisis situation is getting dramatics these days, around the areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, announcing secession from Georgia, for which they are widely supported and encouraged by Russia," the Independent said. According to this London -based newspaper, Moscow's diplomatic defeat over Kosovo's independence has resented Russia, which is now seeking to prove that what applies to Kosovo can be applied to these two Georgian areas in which most people speak Russian. Georgia therefore refused to join the European consensus on Kosovo and to meet the independence of the new Balkan state and offered a federal landscaping of the country, with a significant increase in Abkhazia's rights. Such an offer was rejected by local authorities in Suhumi, insisting on complete independence, although they are said to be more feared that they could be annexed by Russia.

20504	CLASSLA-web.mk.553485	https://vesti24.mk/mertsedes-go-kreirashe-avtobusot-na-idninata/	vesti24.mk	Promotion	Мерцедес го креираше автобусот на иднината                             Патувањето беше импресивно, без возач, а на патот имаше семафори, пешачки премини, патни станици, тунели... Автобусот изобилува со модерни технологии, како разни безжични врски, радари, камери.                             Future Bus се заснова на актуелниот 12-метарски модел Citaro што се движи на мотор со шест цилиндри од 229 коњски сили, и тоа е единственото конвенционално нешто што е задржано во него.                             Имено, минатата година, полу-автоматскиот автобус на "Мерцедес" помина речиси 20-километарска делница од аеродромот Шипол во Амстердам до блиското гратче Харлем.                             Компанијата се обложува дека ваквите автобуси кои сами возат, ќе станат нужност во иднина, па затоа и очекуваат зголемена побарувачка за моделот Future Bus.                             Со употребата на технолошката платформа која во "Мерцедес" ја нарекуваат CityPilot, автобусот е претворен во возило кое е способно самостојно да се движи.                             Системот го чинат 10 камери, четири радари и две стерео камери кои на автобусот му овозможуваат да ја перцепира околината во три димензии.                             Заради сето ова, автобусот автоматски маневрира милиметарски прецизно околу рабните камења, ги препознава станиците и застанува на истите, сам ги отвора и затвора вратите за патниците, ги "чита" сите сообраќајни знаци и семафори.                             Сето тоа го прави покомфорно и од човечки возач, а притоа, штеди и на гориво. Патниците во текот на возењето можат да користат безжична мрежа, имаат на располагање и безжични полначи за мобилни телефони и да следат забавни емисии на екраните кои се сместени во внатрешноста на автобусот.                             	227	Mercedes created the future bus bus was impressive, without a driver, and on the road there were traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, road stations, tunnels ... The bus abounds in modern technologies, such as various wireless connections, radar, cameras. Future Bus is based on the current 12-meter Citaro model moving on a six-cylinder engine of 229 horsepower, and this is the only conventional thing that is retained in it. Namely, last year, the Mercedes semi-automatic bus passed an almost 20-kilometer section of the Shipol Airport in Amsterdam to the nearby town of Harlem. The company bets that such buses that drive will become a necessity in the future, so they expect increased demand for the Future Bus. With the use of a technological platform that Mercedes calls CityPilot, the bus is converted into a vehicle capable of moving independently. The system is cost 10 cameras, four radar and two stereo cameras that allow the bus to perceive the environment in three dimensions. Because of all this, the bus automatically maneuvers millimeter precisely around the rim stones, recognizes the stations and stops on them, opens and closes the doors for passengers, "reading" all traffic signs and traffic lights. It makes this more comfortable than a human driver, while saving on fuel. Passengers can use wireless networks, and wireless chargers for mobile phones, and follow entertaining shows on the screens located inside the bus.

Само една лажичка маслиново масло дневно може да ви помогне да живеете подолго, тврдат експертите. Маслиновото масло, кое е клучна компонента на медитеранската исхрана, позната е како една од најздравите намирници.                             Сега, докторката Сара Бревер и експертот за диети Џулиет Келов, во својата најнова книга "Eat better live longer", тврдат дека маслото може да ви го продолжи животот.                             Тие тврдат дека маслиновото масло содржи антиоксиданси кои можат да помогнат во превенција или во забавување на растот на ракот, како и тоа дека можат да го намалат ризикот од срцев и мозочен удар – две состојби кои се одговорни за најмногу смртни случаи во светот.                             И додека го намалува ризикот од зголемен холестерол, крвен притисок и болести поврзани со годините, маслиновото масло ги подобрува и когнитивните функции.                             Една лажичка маслиново масло содржи околу 100 калории, според Бревер и Келов, така што треба да се консумира во умерени количини.                             Според нив, најдобро е една лажичка дневно.                             Исто така, маслиновото масло содржи голем процент на мононезаситени масти (мононезаситени киселини), кои помагаат во намалувањето на холестеролот и го елиминираат ризикот за мозочен и срцев удар.                             Маслиновото масло изобилува и со витамин Е, кој е одговорен за убава кожа, како и за зајакнување на имунолошкиот систем.

Only one teaspoon of olive oil can help you live longer, experts say. Olive oil, which is a key component of the Mediterranean diet, is known as one of the healthiest foods. Now, Dr. Sarah Brever and diets expert Juliet Kelov, in her latest book "Eat Better Live Longer", claim that the oil can extend your life. They argue that olive oil contains antioxidants that can help prevent or slow the growth of cancer, as well as that they can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke - two conditions responsible for the most deaths in the world. And as it reduces the risk of high cholesterol, blood pressure and age -related diseases, olive oil also improves cognitive functions. One teaspoon of olive oil contains about 100 calories, according to Brever and Kelov, so it should be consumed in moderation. According to them, one teaspoon is best. Olive oil also contains a high percentage of monounsaturated fats (monounsaturated acids), which help lower cholesterol and eliminate the risk of stroke and heart attack.

Во ваква ситуација 60% од анкетираните вработени во технолошкиот сектор (од вкупно 6.000 испитаници) изјавиле дека се чувствуваат недоволно платени.                             Ваквото расположение е и покрај тоа што просечната почетна плата на "програмер" во САД изнесува на 110.000 долари годишно, со што тие влегуваат во топ 5% на најдобро платени професии во земјата.                             Едно од објаснувањата за вака масовната разочараност сред така добро платен сектор е дека најголемиот дел од овие вработени живеат во Силициумската долина или во Сан Франциско, една од најскапите области на САД.                             Друго објаснување се базира на транспарентноста на платите во индустријата. Според ова и покрај тоа што заработуваш 150.000 долари годишно, не ти е право кога некој на не многу повисоко ниво од тебе е платен 300 или 400 илјади долари.                             Меѓу заклучоците на истражувањето има дека:                             - Топ петте компании во кои најголем број вработени сметаат дека се недоволно платени се основани пред 1998.                             - Нетфликс има најголем број на вработени кои изјавиле дека се сметаат дека се доволно платени, 81%.                             - Фејсбук има најголем процент на вработени кои сметаат дека се претерано платени, речиси 14%.                             	216	The poor unpaid programmers for a better perception are a sector in which the apprentices are paid for $ 50 an hour, fresh graduates receive $ 100,000 bonuses to sign an employment contract, and the average employee earns twice as much as the US average. In this situation, 60% of the surveyed technology sector (out of a total of 6,000 respondents) said they felt insufficiently paid. Such a mood is despite the average starting salary of a "programmer" in the United States at $ 110,000 a year, making them the top 5% of the country's best -paid professions. One of the explanations for this mass disappointment in the midst of such a well -paid sector is that most of these employees live in the Silicon Valley or San Francisco, one of the most expensive areas of the United States. Another explanation is based on the transparency of wages in the industry. Accordingly, although you earn $ 150,000 a year, you are not right when someone is $ 300 or $ 400,000 at a not much higher level. Among the conclusions of the research are that: - The top five companies in which most employees consider to be insufficiently paid before 1998. - Netflix has the largest number of employees who said they were considered enough, 81%. - Facebook has the highest percentage of employees who think they are overly paid, almost 14%.

СЕ ОТФРЛА иницијативата за оценување уставноста на а) членовите 277, 278, 394, 395 и 396 од Законот за облигационите односи и б) Заклучоците за примена на прописите кои ги регулираат затезните камати сметано од 1 јануари 1988 година, донесени од Врховниот суд на Република Македонија на 12 октомври 1989 година. 2. На Уставниот суд на Република Македонија Душко Чангов од Скопје му поднесе иницијатива со барање за оценување уставноста на актите означени под а) и б) во точката 1 од ова решение, затоа што одредбите од Законот биле меѓусебно неусогласени; не предвидувале материјалната штета на доверителот да се усогласува со тековите на инфлацијата во стопанството и пропишувале кога да не се применува конформната метода при пресметувањето на затезната камата, што не било согласно со Уставот на Република Македонија. 3. Согласно членот 110 од Уставот, Уставниот суд на Република Македонија одлучува за согласноста на законите со Уставот и за согласноста на другите прописи со Уставот и законите. Со оглед на тоа што со иницијативата се бара оценување на меѓусебната согласност на одредбите од членовите 277 и 278 од означениот закон согласно горенаведената одредба од Уствот, Судот оцени дека барањето излегува од доменот на надлежноста на овој Суд. Исто така, во врска со наводите во иницијиативата дека при формулацијата на членовите 394, 395 и 396 од Законот не се водело грижа за инфлаторните состојби во земјата, Судот оцени дека не е опортуно да се впушта во таква оценка од причина што е тоа прашање на законодавната политика на една земја во дадениот момент. Што се однесува до прашањето, пак, дали одредбата од членот 394 од Законот, која го обврзува должникот кога неговата обврска паретставува одреден износ во пари, да го исплати оној број на парични единици на кои гласи обврската, требала да предвиди додатна одредба со која бројот на паричните единици би се определувал односно усогласувал со инфлацијата, Судот оцени дека со иницијативата не се бара оценување уставноста на Законот затоа што содржи одредба што не се согласна со Уставот, туку поради отсуство на одредба за која подносителот на иницијативата смета дека треба да биде содржана, поради што согласно член 110 од Уставот на Република Македонија, иницијативата ја отфрли како ненадлежен за одлучување. 4. Во врска со оценката на уставноста на Заклучоците на Врховниот суд на Република Македонија, Судот оцени дека тие претставуваат еден вид интерен акт – упатство според кое треба да се придржуваат судовите при утврдувањето на затезните камати по одделни предмети и дека со нив не се востановуваат нови права и обврски, туку само упатуваат како треба да постапуваат пониските судови, заради воедначување на судската практика односно дека тие се во функција на обезбедување на единство во примена на законите. 5. Врз основа на изнесеното, Судот одлучи како во точката 1 од ова решение. 6. Ова решение Судот го донесе мнозинствено во состав од претседателот на Судот д-р Јован Проевски и судиите Бахри Исљами, д-р Никола Крлески, Олга Лазова, д-р Стојмен Михајловски, д-р Милан Недков, Бесим Селими, д-р Јосиф Талевски и д-р Тодор Џунов.У.бр.75/94                             	496	75/1994-0-0 75/1994-0-0 1.

Токмутакво место се прекрасните Бабакарини водопади, за кои веруваме малкумина од нас знаат и дека постојат. По направената анкета на прашањето : Дали знаете дека во Кратово постојат водопади?, малкумина кратовци одговорија потврдно, додека поголемиот број одговори беа негативни, односно поголемиот дел од населението од Кратово не е информирано за водопадите, кои патем не се некаде далеку во планините, туку на само 5-10 минути одење од вашиот дом.                             Инспирирани од нивната убавина, екипата на АБЕРЏИЈА тргна да ги истражи и во полн сјај да и ги презентира на кратовската јавност. Од повеќето водопади кои ги откривме на територијата на нашата Општина, во првиот број ќе ви ги презентираме убавините на водопадите на Бабакарина река. Кога би имало организиран пристап до нив, но и нивна промоција, веруваме дека би претставувале вистинска атракција за домашните и за странските туристи и би станале привлечно место за посета.                             	181	Thursday, January 21, 2010 18:21 Oliver Arsovski 0 Comments A place where we will really feel nature, where we will find tranquility and peace, a place where we can really enjoy the beautiful sights it offers.

Дека бојата на собата влијае на дебелината, открија научниците од Лондон. Овој разочарувачки заклучок нема да им се допадне на луѓето кои сакаат бела боја. Ако вашата спална соба е премногу осветлена, со бели sидови и мебел во иста боја, можете да се соочите со нарушување на циклусот на спиење кој доведува до зголемување на телесната тежина.                             Според студијата на англиските научници кои ја истражувале оваа тема, жените кои ноќеваат во простории каде сè е во бела боја, имаат прекумерна тежина и тенденција за ноќни закуски.                             Истражувачите го припишуваат овој тренд на нарушување на биоритмот поради лошото осветлување. Белите sидови и изобилството на вештачка светлина можат да го променат расположението, физичката сила и дури процесот на варење на храната кај луѓето. Исто така, љубителите на бели кревети често се на диета и имаат зависност од храна.

Од ова околу 65 отсто отпаѓа на таблет компјутерите, а 35 отсто на паметните телефони. Emarketer очекува јазот помеѓу уредите во иднина уште повеќе да се продлабочи и таблет компјутерите да бидат уште подоминантни.

Како што веќе кино љубителите открија, HFR 3D е технолошки чекор напред во кино искуството. Иновативниот формат нуди 48 слики во секунда (fps), што е повеќе од стандардното, но кое човечкото око може да го регистрира.

Моменталниот стандард е 24 слики во секунда. HFR 3D е формат со 48 слики во секунда, што е два пати повеќе снимени и прикажани слики. Кај HFR технологијата се работи според потполно нова постапка на ракување со камерата. Поради ова движењата во филмот изгледаат пореални. Сензационалното кино доживување е загарантирано кај 3D филмовите, бидејќи позадината е брилијатно оштра, а со самото тоа и 3D ефектот дополнително се зголемува. Дали е HFR достапен само во 3D формат?                             Да. HFR верзијата на филмот "Хобит: Пустошот на Смауг" е достапен само како 3D формат. Имам ли избор?                             Да. Филмот ќе биде објавен и прикажан во различни формати. Во киното Cineplexx во Скопје ќе биде достапен и во Дигитал формат. Дали се потребни посебни 3D очила?                             Очилата кои ќе ги добиете во киното за 3D проекциите, се користат и за HFR 3D проекции.

Притоа, Судот смета дека правото на надзор над законитоста на работењето на општината, што според Уставот го има Републиката, не може во себе да го опфати и преземањето на функциите на општината од страна на државните органи и субјективитетот на органите и јавните установи односно претпријатија што таа ги формирала, независно од причините поради кои таквите овластувања се предвидуваат во законите.                             	122	58/2001-0-0 58/2001-0-0 6.

Во новата епизода на емисијата "Докторите" се зборуваше за црнките. Тоа не е ништо ново, ниту пак алармантно, но во овој случај станува збор за црнки на место каде што никогаш не би помислиле дека ќе се појават.                             Односно, докторите наговестуваат дека сосема е нормално и постои голема можност да се појават црнки во ушите, со оглед на тоа дека надворешниот дел од ушите кој е видлив има многу лојни жлезди, какви што имаме на носот или брадата.                             Секако, веројатноста дека ќе Ви се појават црнки на носот или брадата е поголема, но постои голема можност дека тие можат да ги нападнат и Вашите уши. Особено, тоа може да се случи доколку често носите слушалки во ушите или доколку не ги одржувате редовно.                             Покрај тоа, докторите предуредуваат дека доколку забележите ваква појава, случајот не смеете да го решавате сами, туку да се обратите кај дерматолог. Во спротивно, тие црнки би можеле да го затнат и ушниот канал.                             Како да одбегнете вакво сценарио?                             Пред сè, редовно чистете ги ушите. Чепкалките за уши нема да ви помогнат во тоа, бидејќи само повеќе ја турката нечистотијата.

Иако можеме да се надеваме на најдоброто, дека тој едноставно ќе исчезне од нашиот живот, сепак на нас останува да преземеме нешто.                             Ова се мали навики кои можеме да ги вметнеме во нашето секојдневие, а кои ќе ни помогнат да се ослободиме од хаосот, а и стресот во нашиот живот.                             Направете си распоред                             Не мора да седнете и да правите големи распореди, туку едноставно размислете колку време ви зазема секоја од задачите и одговорностите кои ги имате во текот на денот. На тој начин, ќе си помогнете да бидете поорганизирани, но и посвесни за тоа колку време ви е потребно за различните работи, без оглед на тоа дали сакате или не сакате да ги правите.                             Ослободете се од хаосот во вашиот дом                             Наместо да собирате работи кои никогаш нема да ви бидат потребни, одвојте еден ден да се ослободите од старите предмети, облеката и другите работи кои не ви се потребни. На тој начин, ќе создадете повеќе простор, а и ќе имате можност да го организирате тој дел од домот кој ви создава нервоза.                             Не брзајте премногу                             Немојте да мислите дека работите се одвиваат преку ноќ. Одете чекор по чекор за секоја работа која планирате да ја направите и не се оптоварувајте премногу ако работите не се одвиваат онака како што вие сте замислиле. Пуштете ги да се одвиваат по својот тек и опуштете се.                             Направете план кога да се видите со пријателите                             Без оглед на тоа колку сте зафатени, најдете време за своите пријатели. Не ја заменувајте реалната конекција со социјалните мрежи со оправдувањето дека сте премногу зафатени со различни обврски. Гответе заедно, одете на кино, одете на вежбање, сретнете се за пијачка. Ислушајте ги и дозволете тие да го направат истото.                             Минувајте време во природа                             Голем дел од нервозата и главоболките се јавуваат бидејќи минуваме премногу време внатре, во затворени простории заглавени со технологијата. Одете на прошетка за време на паузата, најдете време да седнете на клупа во паркот после работа. Не мора да биде сложено и долго, доволно е да го избистрите умот во природа.                             Не заборавајте на сонот                             Не го одложувајте одењето на спиење. Посветете голем напор да одите на спиење во време кое вам ви одгова и да спиете 8 часа во текот на ноќта. Не наоѓајте причини да го одложувате сонот и да останувате доцна.                             Развијте рутина за релаксација                             Најдете време по работа или училиште да креирате навика која ви помага да се релаксирате. Тоа може да е книга, филм, серија.

"Старецот и морето" – Ернест Хемингвеј (The Old Man and the Sea)                             Книгата "Старецот и морето" е во голема мера заслужна за Нобеловата награда за литература што ја добил Хемингвеј во 1954 година. Станува збор за навидум едноставна приказна за еден стар рибар кој се обидува да улови голема риба марлин. Меѓутоа, ова дело го докажува фактот дека Хемингвеј е експерт за чистото и јасно пишување, без непотребни зборови. Иако е реална, приказната ги воведува читателите во ситуација каква што никогаш нема да сретнат во вистински живот.                             "Тивкиот Американец" е директна критика на бесмисленоста на војната. Грин добил инспирација од периодот што го поминал во Француска Индокина како воен дописник. Книгата јасно покажува дека Грин пишувал за место и проблем што имал значително влијание на него. Ова дело е еден вид шпионски роман со многу голема длабочина.                             7. "Бисер" – Џон Стајнбек (The Pearl)                             Класикот "Бисер" е адаптација на мексиканска народна приказна за млад човек кој наоѓа голем и убав бисер и се надева дека ќе може да го продаде за добра цена за да му плати на докторот и да му помогне на неговото болно дете. Меѓутоа, бисерот ја извлекува најзлобната и најалчната страна од луѓето кои доаѓаат во допир со него. Станува збор за кратко, но инспиративно четиво.                             "Кланица пет" можеби ќе ви делува како еден од подолгите романи на оваа листа, но благодарение на вонземјаните, патувањето низ времето, историјата на Втората Светска војна и личните анегдоти, нема ни да забележите дека поминало толку време откако ќе го прочитате најпознатото дело на Вонегат. Книгата се заснова на времето што го поминал писателот како војник во Дрезден за време на Втората Светска војна и содржи толку многу различни елементи што никако не може строго да се определи нејзината припадност во одреден жанр. Можеби најсоодветен назив за ова дело е историска научна фантастика, но ќе мора самите да го прочитате за да одлучите.

"The Elder and the Sea" - The Old Man and the Sea) The book "The Elder and the Sea" is largely credited with the Nobel Prize for Literature that Hemingway received in 1954. It's a seemingly simple story about an old fisherman trying to catch a big Marlin fish. However, this work proves the fact that Hemingway is an expert on pure and clear writing, without unnecessary words. Although realistic, the story introduces readers into a situation that they will never meet in real life. The "quiet American" is a direct criticism of the nonsense of war. Green received inspiration from the period he spent in French Indochina as a military correspondent. The book clearly shows that Green wrote about a place and problem that had a significant impact on it. This work is a kind of spy novel with a very great depth. 7. "Pearl" - The Pearl Classic "Pearl" is an adaptation of a Mexican folk story for a young man who finds a big and beautiful pearl and hopes to sell him for a good price to pay the doctor and to help his sick child. However, the pearl extracts the most glorious and most important side of the people who come in contact with it. It's a short but inspiring reading. "Slaughterhouse Pet" may seem to you as one of the longer novels on this list, but thanks to aliens, time travel, World War II history and personal anecdotes, you will not even notice that so much time has been since reading the most famous work of Vonnegate. The book is based on the time the writer has spent as a soldier in Dresden during World War II and contains so many different elements that it cannot strictly determine its belonging to a genre. Perhaps the most appropriate name for this work is a historical science fiction, but you will have to read it yourself to decide.

"Slaughterhouse Pet" may seem to you as one of the longer novels on this list, but thanks to aliens, time travel, World War II history and personal anecdotes, you will not even notice that so much time has been since reading the most famous work ofVonnegate.The book is based on the time the writer has spent as a soldier in Dresden during World War II and contains so many different elements that it cannot strictly determine its belonging to a genre.Perhaps the most appropriate name for this work is a historical science fiction, but you will have to read it yourself to decide.

За јавноста е познато дека Арифи лично се справила со болеста пред неколку години поминувајќи низ третман. Во тој период таа беше делумно повлечена од политиката, а подоцна, по целосното закрепнување, се врати активно. На настанот таа ја раскажува својата приказна и авторот на текстот цитира:                             Пред десетина години успеав да направам две операции, всушност, додека бев бремена, по тие две операции да родам дете, потоа да одам на терапија, да ја изгубам косата за повторно да ми порасне, а после тоа двапати да победам на изборите во општина Тетово, и, на крај, да се справам со проблемите што не се едноставни, пишува во текстот што го разгледуваме, без да се стават наводници за да се одреди делот од цитатот.                             Всушност, ова се воведните зборови на текстот и само според значењето или некаде близу крајот на текстот, сфаќате дека станува збор за цитат. Но, како што може да се види јасно, Арифи воопшто не зборува за политичкиот аспект како победила на локалната трка на изборите. Текстот ја нема соодветната структура на една вест од аспект на тоа како е ставен насловот на текстот, а и според други елементи.                             Насловот надвор од контекстот                             Брзо се сфаќа дека насловот не е поврзан со остатокот од текстот и, иако му ветува на читателот одредено појаснување на друга тема, целосно го става надвор од контекстот.                             Очигледно, авторот проценил дека таков наслов може да предизвика поголем интерес и да привлече повеќе кликови отколку наслов што би разјаснил дека Арифи зборува од позицијата на политичар за својата битка со ракот на дојката, а не од позицијата на градоначалник, за механизмите за победа на политичката битка во двата мандата.                             Техники на манипулација                             Авторот ги игнорира основните податоци само за да ја постигне својата цел и да привлече внимание, но без заслуги. Ова го прави текстот непрофесионален. Објективно гледано, авторот требаше да ја следи изјавата на Арифи во рамките на контекстот и така да го претстави во насловот.                             Или, пак, овој наслов би бил соодветен само доколку авторот би направил анализа што би го вклучила ставот на Арифи за мобилизација и начинот како таа ги освоила двата мандата како градоначалничка, без да се вметне тука борбата со ракот на дојката, затоа што овие две работи воопшто не се поврзани.                             За читателите                             Еден ваков наслов би го привлекло вниманието на сите затоа што е изграден за таа цел. Но, кога текстот не успева да го испорача тоа што е ветено, тој напис мора да се земе со многу резерви и со критичко око. Читателот треба да знае дека без јасна структура со главниот "извор" во веста, со извори и факти, веста е нецелосна и непрофесионална.

In fact, these are the introductory words of the text and only according to the meaning or somewhere near the end of the text, you realize that it is a quote. But as can be seen clearly, Arifi does not talk about the political aspect of winning the local election race. The text does not have the appropriate structure of one news in terms of how the title of the text is placed, and according to other elements. The title outside the context is quickly understood that the title is not related to the rest of the text and, although it promises the reader a certain clarification on another topic, completely puts it out of the context. Obviously, the author estimated that such a title could cause greater interest and attract more clicks than a title that would clarify that Arifi speaks from a politician's position of his battle with breast cancer, not mayor's position, about the mechanisms of winning political battle in both terms. Manipulation techniques ignore basic data just to achieve its goal and attract attention, but without merit. This makes the text unprofessional. Objectively, the author had to follow Arifi's statement in the context and thus present it in the title. Or, this title would only be appropriate if the author were analyzing Arifi's position on mobilization and the way she won the two terms as a mayor, without incorporating the fight with breast cancer, because these two things are not connected at all. For readers, such a title would attract everyone's attention because it was built for that purpose. But when the text fails to deliver what is promised, that article must be taken with a lot of reserves and with a critical eye.

Во 2018 година Розевата Месечина се паѓа на 29 и 30 на 16 степен во Скорпија. Времето на Полна Месечина не поттикнува на промени, а кога е во знакот на трансформирачка Скорпија, тогаш не инспирира да направиме коренити промени во своите животи.                             Полната Месечина во април често се нарекува Розева Месечина, затоа што се смета за носител на женската среќа и таа што ја покренува пролетната среќа. Скорпијата претставува смрт, повторно раѓање и безусловна љубов. На површина е егоистичен, но всушност е полн со љубов.

Сакам да си купам некоја убава сет гарнитура со крцкалки и сите тракатанци т.е. ми треба разновиден алат. Па да ми препорачате некое место каде може да се види добар алат. Или ако вие користите нешто па сте задоволни од истото да предложите.                             " Последно менување: Ноември 26, 2017, 01:28:31 am Deno "                             Каде што работам користиме неколку брендови на алати. Бормашини и ударни одвртувачи(штрафелици) од брендот на Metabo и Bosch за професионална употреба(батериски).Зверови,нема смрт. Рачести клучеви,насадни клучеви,шрафцигери,битови,торксови од програмната на Униор и Wera.Wera е за пет класи над Униорот. Ова се професионални алати кои чинат троа поќе.                             За домашна употреба доволно е и Ineco,Stanley.                             За домашни потреби имам Bleck&Decker бормашина и мала брусалица,презадоволен. Погледни тука                             Ако бараш квалитет: wera, beta, hazet, snapon, usag, bacho... За клешти: knipex. На некој форум прочитав униор имал неколку класи. Инаку прашај алатот што е на акција во лидл каков е. Мислам за домошна употреба ќе ти заврши работа.                             Кој ја носи Wera, што бренд е? Треба да зимаме поприлична количина на профи алат ама прв пат слушам за брендов. До сега сме користеле: Gedore, Beta, Snap on, Stalhwille i Unior. Сега бараме нешто добар однос цена квалитет затоа што последно што зимавме и тоа што е бренд некако не е тоа тоа..Ние би Snap on ама е значително поскап.                             Стар Униор алат нема гајле ама новите се катастрофа. Туку од тие купи алат шо се на фејсбук зимал некој?                             Јас земав една гарнитура Extol Premium од кај нив, задоволен од квалитетот. Ако збориме за оние кај тутунски комбинат што им е продавницата.                             Јас купив пластична крцкалка Extol Premium со 30 и нешто битови направени од CrV, битовите и крцкалката излегоа појаки од штраф со кој е заштрафена ВРАТА на Ксарата.                             Со крцкалката имам вадено седишта (исто доста јако зашрафени), 3-4 лаптопи расклопив, по дома ја малтретирам за све и свашта, уште си работи. Барем 2 пати ги имам вратено тие 440 денари што ги платив за комплетот.                             Ја си имам Irimo сет крцкала за по дома, ги малтретирам доста, топ се, клешти, штрафцигери и клучеви ми се Bahco и Unior, задоволен сум од се, со тоа што рачните клучеви се од дедо Ное Unior, клештите 4-5 типа се bahco и се врв!                             Сум. Видов на реклама 5 еден оглас продават само Force и се јавив имале продавница у Скопје у Ѓорче мислам дека ми кажаа.

Не е Ветел пичка, пичка е тимот на Ферари што не го пуштија малиот да го помине Ветел. Можеа бар да го пратат во бокс, да му ставеа меки гуми и да им го украдеа тој 1 бод на Мерцедес а и немаше да биде толку очигледна тимската одлука.                             Треба да си наивен да помислиш дека и со нови гуми ветел или леклерк имаа шанси за најбрз круг кога цело време битката за најдобро време беше помеѓу ботас и верстапен. Да останеа уште неколку круга и хамилтон ќе го јадеше од верстапен.                             Белки ова нема да е случај за цела сезона... Како и да е, со оглед на разликата меѓу ферари и мерцедес, лани ферари имаа далеку повеќе шанси за титула. Сега како за почеток, имаат неконкурентен болид, на тоа да додадеме лошата стратегија и резултатот е јасен. Уште да почнат да ги повтарат грешките од лани...

Одма отказ со него и тоа педерчето што го замени Аривабене..

Да освоиш пол позиција и на крај 20 секунди да заостануваш во ист болид зад вингменот Ботас, нешто не штима... Едниов немаше спремен болид за трка, на другиов му фалело делови од подот на болидот.                             Абе глупо е тоа што го вратија Леклер од напад кој ќе беше сигурно успешен и ќе беше голема мотивација за него како за прва трка во тој тим. Вака виде со кои гомна си има работа и дека цела сезона ќе треба да изиграва помијарка и да одработува за некој друг. Се надевам следните трки ќе има значително подобро темпо од Фетел, па ќе си преземе сам некои акции без да прашува.                             Немојте да мислите дека не знае Леклер кај е и што му е улогата.                             Сочувана                             	343	Vettel has a bad car. They call them what are we so slow these radio are returning to the know Yet. Tour the ashes of such a team. It's not a pussy pussy, Ferrari's team that didn't let the little one pass by Vettel. They could have a bar in boxing, put on soft tires and stole that 1 point on Mercedes and would not be such an obvious team decision. You have to be naive to think that with new tires Vettel or Leclerc they had the chance of the fastest lap when the battle for the best time was between Botas and Versailles. If there were a few more rounds and Hamilton would have eaten from Versailles. White this will not be the case for the whole season ... However, given the difference between Ferrari and Mercedes, last year Ferrari had a far more chance of a title. Now, for starters, they have a non -competitive car, adding bad strategy and the result is clear. Still starting to make the mistakes of last year ... they will be below Renault in the end. Aside, I said to me when he missed Versailles without any resistance. Immediately dismissed with him and the fagot that replaced Arivabene. To win a pole position and finally 20 seconds to lag in the same car behind Wingman Botas, something does not shine ... One had no ready -made race, the other one was boasting parts of the car's floor. It is silly that they returned Lecler from an attack that would have been successful and would be a great motivation for him as the first race in that team. He saw this way with whom he worked and that he would have to play a decent and work for someone else all season. Hopefully the next races will have a significantly better pace than Vettel, so he will take some actions alone without asking. Do not think that he does not know LEAVER where he is and what his role is. Preserved	Forum	Hard example, could be Opinion/Argumentation as well.

Ne, brez skrbi! Niste se vrnili v avgust 1982, ko se je rodil slavni predhodnik današnjega modela. Današnje podjetje Commodore, ki nima praktično nič skupnega z nekdaj slavnim podjetjem (razen odkupljenih pravic za uporabo imena), je predstavilo nov C64, ki je na videz res skoraj identičen ikoni iz osemdesetih let prejšnjega stoletja, a se v drobovju nahaja klasičen PC.                             Gre za torej nekakšen Keyboard PC, računalnik v tipkovnici, ki temelji na procesorju Intel Atom 525, nabori Nvidia Ion2, 4 GB RAM, 1 TB diskovja, DVD ali Blu-ray zapisovalnikom,, dvema izhodoma DVI in izhodom HDMI, šestimi vhodi USB, vmesniki Wi-Fi in bluetooth ter bralci šestih tipov kartic. Svetlobno leto daleč od prvotnega C64, ki je imel procesor MOS 6150, 64 KB RAM in 20 KB ROM, namesto diska pa drag kasetofon ali pa še dražjo disketno enoto.                             Nekaj pridiha preteklosti pa novi C64 vendarle ponuja. Uporabniki se lahko ob zagonu namesto operacijskega sistema (Windows, Linux) odločijo, da zaženejo neposredno emulator starega C64 in na njem preizkusijo svoje znanje Basica ali pa računalniških iger iz časov, ko se je osebno računalništvo šele začelo. Tak računalnik, ki verno oponaša vzornika, celo z nenavadno postavljenimi funkcijskimi tipkami vred, je že mogoče naročiti za 595 do 895 dolarjev, odvisno od konfiguracije.                             Commodore pa je hkrati obudil še nekaj slavnih imen. Računalnika VIC Pro in VIC Slim prav tako vračata spomin na slavni VIC-20, vendar gre tokrat za oblikovno drugačne računalnike Keyboard PC, s podobnimi lastnostmi kot zgoraj omenjeni C64. V načrtih pa imajo tudi tri nove Amige, ki pa bodo v drobovju tokrat vendarle vsebovale PC arhitekturo.                             	271	The Commodore C64 Commodore USA started selling its latest C64 computer. No, no worries! You did not return to August 1982, when the famous predecessor of today's model was born. Today's commodore company, which has virtually nothing in common with the formerly famous company (except for the purchased rights for use of the name), has introduced a new C64, which is seemingly almost identical to the icon from the 1980s, but is a classic PC in the gut. It is therefore a kind of keyboard PC, a computer in a keyboard based on Intel Atom 525 processor, Nvidia Ion2, 4GB RAM, 1 TB disk, DVD or Blu Wi-Fi and Bluetooth interfaces and six card types. Light year far from the original C64, which had the MOS 6150, 64 KB RAM and 20 KB ROM, and instead of the disc, expensive cassetophone or an even more expensive floppy unit. However, some C64 flair is offered by the new C64. Users can decide when starting a operating system (Windows, Linux) to start an old C64 direct emulator and test their bass skills or computer games from times when personal computer science has just begun. Such a computer that faithfully imitates the role model, even with unusually positioned function keys, can already be ordered for $ 595 to $ 895, depending on the configuration. At the same time, Commodore has revived some famous names. The Vic Pro and Vic Slim computer also return the memory of the famous VIC-20, but this time it is a different Keyboard PC computers, with similar features to the C64 mentioned above.

OBRAZLOŽITEV: Z izpodbijanim sklepom je sodišče ugovor toženih strank zavrnilo. Proti takšnemu sklepu se je pritožila tožena stranka iz vseh pritožbenih razlogov. Zatrjuje, da niso bili podani pogoji za začasno odredbo, prizna, da je tožeča stranka pridobila pravico do sklenitve pogodbe, ker je pravočasno sprejela ponudbo. Tožba pa je bila vložena po izteku 60 dnevnega roka. Gre za prekluzivni rok, ki je iztekel 21.4.2008, tožba pa je bila vložena dne 29.4.2008. S prekluzijo je prenehala terjatev. Ni podana nevarnost za realizacijo terjatve, saj kakršnakoli prodaja podleže pravilom Zakona o kmetijskih zemljiščih, zato ni možna prodaja pod roko. Predlaga ugoditev pritožbi. Tožeča stranka v odgovoru na pritožbo predlaga potrditev sklepa. Pritožba ni utemeljena. Sodišče je pravilno in zanesljivo ugotovilo vse pogoje za izdano začasno odredbo po čl. 272 Zakona o izvršbi in zavarovanju. Obstoj verjetnosti terjatve (dolžnost skleniti kupoprodajno pogodbo zaradi varstva predkupne pravice) ni zanikala niti tožena stranka, saj ni prerekala ugotovitve, da je bila ponudba za nakup zemljišča podana pravočasno. Seveda pa ni mogoče mešati materialnih in procesnih predpostavk, kot je pravilno ugotovilo sodišče prve stopnje. Glede zatrjevane prepozno vložene tožbe, se tožena stranka moti, ko zatrjuje datum vložitve 29.4.2008, saj je bila tožba priporočeno oddana na pošto dne 28.4.2008. O pravočasnosti tožbe sodišče še ni odločilo, vendar eventualna prekluzija ne vpliva na verjetnost obstoja terjatve, saj ima tožeča stranka pravico do zavarovanja zahtevka, dokler sodišče ne odloči v glavni stvari o vseh procesnih in materialnih vprašanjih. Ugotovljeno pa je bilo zanesljivo, da je terjatev nastala s pravočasno ponudbo. Sodišče je pravilno ugotovilo kar dva alternativna pogoja za izdajo začasne odredbe. Pravilno je ugotovljena nevarnost, da bo uveljavitev terjatve onemogočena, saj sta toženca kljub predkupni pravici sklenila pogodbo z M. in V. Z. Pravilna je tudi ocena sodišča, da tožeča stranka v primeru odsvojitve dobrovernemu nasledniku ne bi mogla uveljavljati uspešno nobenega zahtevka. Sodišče je ugotovilo še nadaljnji alternativni pogoj za začasno odredbo, da tožena stranka z njo ne bo utrpela nobenih neugodnih posledic, na drugi strani pa tožeča stranka ob eventualni prodaji nepremičnine ne bi mogla uveljavljati zahtevkov proti dobrovernemu pridobitelju. Sicer pa tožena stranka indirektno v pritožbi priznava odsotnost neugodnih posledic, ko trdi, da prodaja pod roko itak ni možna. Glede na zavrnitev pritožbe, pritožnik sam trpi pritožbene stroške; stroški za odgovor na pritožbo pa niso potrebni pritožbeni stroški, saj odgovor ni pripomogel k boljši razjasnitvi zadeve na pritožbeni stopnji.                             rss                             	425	Core: The likelihood of the existence of a claim is assessed by substantive criteria (eg law, contract, etc.) and the likelihood of a claim cannot be influenced by EV.

96038	CLASSLA-web.sl.1461565	http://www.gradovi.net/grad/vrhpolje_dvorec	gradovi.net	Information/Explanation	Dvorec je morda naslednik enega od številnih v virih izpričanih srednjeveških dvorov na širšem območju Vipave. Prvič je bil omenjen leta 1630 v popisu zapuščine Baltazarja pl. Raumschüssla, gospoda na Belneku pri Moravčah na Gorenjskem in v Vrhpolju pri Vipavi. Zaradi lege ob vodi je dobil nemško ime Schönau, ki pomeni Lepi log. Popis njegove zapuščine kaže, da je imela rodovina Raumschüssl že leta 1571 posest v bližini Vrhpolja, v vasi Dolenje na Vipavskem. Domnevno je Vrhpolje, tako kot Belnek, v lasti rodovine Raumschüssl ostal še vse do druge polovice 17. stoletja. Sredi 18. stoletja sta bila dvorec in gospostvo Vrhpolje v lasti rodovine Auersperg. Z dovoljenjem Jožefa Marije grofa Auersperga je bila posest leta 1770 prepisana na Franca Jožefa Martinica. Po njegovi smrti sta se njegova sinova in dediča Jožef in Alojz leta 1792 sporazumela, da jo bo prevzel starejši Jožef in Alojzu izplačal 2.150 goldinarjev. Po Jožefovi smrti leta 1823 jo je podedovala njegova hči Marija, leta 1843 pa je postala lastnica posesti njena mati Marija, ki se je kot vdova ponovno poročila in dobila priimek Repič. Po njeni smrti je leta 1846 posest pripadala njenima mladoletnima sinovoma Francu in Jožefu Repiču. Ko je leta 1884 umrl Jožef Repič, jo je podedoval njegov sin Jožef. V 20. stoletju se je posest razdrobila, grajsko stavbo pa so si delili različni lastniki. Osrednji del dvorca je sedaj zapuščen in prazen, južni del stranskega trakta pa za stanovanjske namene uporablja družina Marc.                             	241	The mansion may be the successor to one of the many sources of medieval courts in the wider Vipava area. It was first mentioned in 1630 in the census of Balthazar's leg. Raumschüssla, the Lord at Belnek near Moravce in the Gorenjska region and in Vrhpolje near Vipava. Due to its location by the water, it got the German name Schönau, which means a beautiful log. The census of his legacy shows that the Ramschüssl lineage had an estate near Vrhpolje in 1571 in the village of Dolenje, Vipava. Supposedly, Vrhpolje, like Belnek, owned the Raumschüssl lineage, remained until the second half of the 17th century. In the mid -18th century, the mansion and domination of Vrhpolje were owned by the Auersperg lineage. With the permission of Joseph Maria Count Auersperg, the estate was transcribed to Franz Joseph Martinica in 1770. After his death, his sons and heirs Joseph and Alojz agreed in 1792 that he would be taken over by older Joseph and paid 2,150 goldinars by Alojz. After Joseph's death in 1823, she was inherited by his daughter Mary, and in 1843 the owner of the estate became her mother Mary, who re -married as a widow and got her surname Repic. After her death, in 1846 the estate belonged to her juvenile sons Franco and Jožef Repič. When Joseph Repic died in 1884, her son Joseph was inherited. In the 20th century, the estate was fragmented, and the castle building was shared by various owners. The central part of the mansion is now abandoned and empty, and the southern part of the side tract is used by the Marc family for residential purposes.

Če imate te znake, še ni nujno, da imate obolelo srce ali ožilje, je pa prav, da obiščete svojega zdravnika in se prepričate o svojem zdravju. Nenehna utrujenost – ta ni povezana s premalo spanja, govorimo o ekstremni utrujenosti, ki se vleče iz dneva v dan, o utrujenosti, ki je podobna bolezni. Če ste brez energije, mlahavi, brez volje, se takoj utrudite, se takoj zadihate, potem obiščite zdravnika. Otekanje stopal – če vam kar naprej otekajo noge, stopala, je to lahko znak, da srce ne deluje pravilno, da kri ne kroži dovolj hitro. Bolečine pri hoji – če med hojo občutite bolečine v mišicah na nogah, če vas med hojo velikokrat zagrabijo krči v mečih, to lahko nakazuje na nepravilnosti arterij. Vrtoglavica – tudi nenehna vrtoglavica je znak za težavo. Lahko je povezana tudi z zamašenimi arterijami.

The relatively warm and rainy weather has a beneficial effect on rapid bud development and creates conditions for peach curl.Therefore, before precipitation, you are advised to sprinkle against peach curls with a barge -based preparations such as: Champion 50 WG (0.5 - 1% conc1.8 kg/ha), cuproxat - old name Kupro 190 SC (1% conc5 kg/ha).  In the case of night temperatures below 0 ° C, due to the risk of burning, spray copper preparations wait until warming.  Warm winter also results in a very early start of budding of apple and pear.In the area of the Celje region, the pears are already in the budding phase B (BBCH 51 - 52), as well as certain varieties of apple: icevič B (BBCH 51 - 52), Breaburn B (BBCH 51), while varieties of Gala, Jonagold, Golden Delesa entryIn the A-B budding phase (BBCH 00-51).Estar and Fuji varieties, however, are still at rest.

66138	CLASSLA-web.sl.2522082	http://arhiv.kzs.si/kzs/index.php?x=2&amp;amp;novica=1497	arhiv.kzs.si	News	Goran Jagodnik, 33-letni krilni košarkar, eden od stebrov slovenske članske reprezentance, ki je na lanskem evropskem prvenstvu osvojila 7. mesto in se s tem prebila v kvalifikacije za letošnje olimpijske igre in na EP 2009, se je 19. januarja očitno precej resno poškodoval. Na gostovanju njegovega Hemofarma v ligi NLB ABA pri Širokem brijegu si je namreč, kot vse kaže pretrgal križne vezi desnega kolena.                             Goran Jagodnik, 203 cm visoki slovenski reprezentant, se je lani izkazal z igrami na evropskem prvenstvu, zelo dobro pa je v tej sezoni igral tudi v ligi NLB ABA, kjer za Hemofarm v povprečju na tekmo zbral po 14,1 točke in 4,5 skoka, ter v pokalu ULEB, v katerem ja za moštvo iz Vršca v povprečju vsak dvoboj nanizal po 13,4 točke in 4,2 skoka.                             "Vse skupaj se je zgodilo precej nedolžno. Pri polaganju sem z vso težo sicer resda pristal na desno nogo, a šele po pristanku me je močno zabolelo. Koleno mi obrnilo navzven, prve preiskave z magnetno resonanco v Novem Sadu pa kažejo na strgane križne vezi. Zdaj me koleno pri hoji sicer skorajda ne boli, a to še zdaleč ne pomeni, da poškodba ni tako resno, kot se trenutno zdi. Kljub vsemu bom verjetno že v torek, najkasneje pa v sredo, prišel v Slovenijo in opravil dodatne preglede, med drugim tudi pri zdravniku slovenske moške članske reprezentance dr. Slobodanu Macuri," o nesrečni poškodbi in naslednjih korakih pravi Goran Jagodnik, katerega okrevanje bi v primeru, da si je kolenske vezi res strgal, trajalo vsaj šest mesecev. To bi pomenilo, da priljubljeni "Jagoda" za slovensko izbrano vrsto na kvalifikacijskem turnirju za preboj na olimpijske igre, ki ga bodo med 14. in 20. julijem gostile Atene, ne bi mogel nastopiti.                             In za konec tako žalostno pove še: "Tako zelo si želim igrati na olimpijskih igrah, da me je novica o tem, da je poškodba tako resno, dobesedno šokirala. Zato ostajam optimist vse, dokler diagnoze ne bodo potrdili tudi slovenski strokovnjaki. Na morebitno operacijo namreč računam v domovini."                             	330	Goran Jagodnik, a 33-year-old wing basketball player, one of the pillars of the Slovenian national team, who won 7th place at last year's European Championships, thus breaking into qualifying for this year's Olympic Games and at the 2009 EP, was clearly quite serious on January 19 hurt. On the roaming of his hemopharme in the NLB ABA League near the Brijeg, he seems to have broken the cross ties of the right knee. Goran Jagodnik, a 203 cm high Slovenian national team player, proved to be played at the European Championships last year, and has also played very well this season in the NLB ABA league, where on average, he collected 14.1 points and 4.5 Jumping, and in the Uleb Cup, in which, on average, each duel scored 13.4 points and 4.2 rebounds for the Vršec team. "It all happened quite innocent. Although I had all the weight on my right leg, it was only after the landing did I get sick. My knee turned outwards, and the first magnetic resonance imaging in Novi Sad shows the cruciate ligaments . Now my knee does not hurt when walking, but that does not mean that the injury is not as serious as it currently seems.

Za tedaj je sklicanih kar 182 skupščin, tako da jih je recimo na isti sklicanih tudi po 30. Prispevek Milana Trobiča. MILAN TROBIČ: To je posmeh delničarstvu, meni tudi predsednik Društva malih delničarjev MDS Rajko Stankovič, ki pravi, da so se letos družbe iz prve borzne kotacije potrdile in so skupščino sklicale prej kot ostale družbe, ki čakajo do zadnjega dne. RAJKO STANKOVIČ: Posebej nas žalosti to, ker te družbe so veliko enostavnejše za preglede in revidiranje in verjamemo, da so te podatke imeli že aprila, maja in bi te skupščine lahko izvedli že prej. Vzrok je pa iskati predvsem v tem poletnem času, kjer določene družbe računajo, da delničarji bodo na oddihu in ne bodo se tako množično udeleževali teh skupščin.                             TROBIČ: V Društvu malih delničarjev MDS se skušajo aktivno udeležiti čim večjega števila skupščin in tako bodo letos sodelovali na 20, pravi Stankovič. STANKOVIČ: Udeležujemo se tako velikih kot majhnih skupščin, največje problematike so pa na tistih prav majhnih, ki so daleč od drobnogleda vas novinarjev, daleč od drobnogleda časopisja in tam so direktorju pravi mali bogovi. TROBIČ: Ob tem je jasno, da družbe čakajo do zadnjega dne in računajo tudi na to, da bodo mali delničarji na dopustu. Tako se zgodi, da se skupščin udeležujejo predvsem večinski lastniki, nadzorniki in poslovodstva, ki zlahka potrdijo tudi kak sporni posel za nazaj. Tega pa v primeru, da bi sodelovali tudi mali delničarji, ki pogosto postavljajo neprijetna vprašanja, ne bi mogli storiti. Zato velja vabilo, da se mali udeležijo čim večjega števila skupščin in se pri tem organizirajo.                             	291	RA Slovenia 1, 02.08.2012, Other Morning Chronicle, 7.00 this year, this month is announced by the real inflation of the joint -stock companies, since they all wait until the end of August, ie the legally defined deadline. As many as 182 assemblies were convened at the time, so, for example, the same are convened after the 30th contribution of Milan Trobic. Milan Trobic: This is a mockery of shareholding, according to the President of the Small Shareholders Association Rajko Stankovic, who says that this year companies have confirmed from the first stock market and convened the assembly earlier than other companies waiting until the last day. Rajko Stankovic: We are particularly saddened by these societies are much easier for reviews and audits and we believe that they had this information in April, May and could have carried out those assemblies earlier. The reason is to look especially in this summer, where certain companies are counting on the shareholders to be on vacation and not so massively participate in these assemblies. Trobic: At the MDS Small Shareholders Association, they are trying to actively attend the number of assemblies as possible, and will participate in 20 this year, says Stankovic. Stankovic: We attend both large and small assemblies, but the biggest issues are on those small ones that are far from the scrutiny of the journalists, far from the scrutiny of the newspaper and there are the real little gods to the director. Trobic: It is clear that companies are waiting until the last day and are also counting on the small shareholders on vacation. It so happens that the assemblies are mainly attended by majority owners, supervisors and management, who also easily confirm some controversial back business. However, if small shareholders who often ask unpleasant questions would be involved, they would not be able to do this. Therefore, the invitation is that the small ones attend as many as possible assemblies and organize themselves.

Trobic: At the MDS Small Shareholders Association, they are trying to actively attend the number of assemblies as possible, and will participate in 20 this year, says Stankovic.Stankovic: We attend both large and small assemblies, but the biggest issues are on those small ones that are far from the scrutiny of the journalists, far from the scrutiny of the newspaper and there are the real little gods to the director.Trobic: It is clear that companies are waiting until the last day and are also counting on the small shareholders on vacation.It so happens that the assemblies are mainly attended by majority owners, supervisors and management, who also easily confirm some controversial back business.However, if small shareholders who often ask unpleasant questions would be involved, they would not be able to do this.Therefore, the invitation is that the small ones attend as many as possible assemblies and organize themselves.

MAMO abonma je v slovenskem prostoru unikaten, saj združuje nevladne in institucionalne mariborske producente. Cilj je občinstvu ponuditi presežne predstave iz mednarodnega prostora, ki se spogledujejo s sodobnim dramskim, postdramskim, plesnim, lutkovnim in eksperimentalnim izrazom. Organizatorji smo izbrali predstave, ki po ustvarjalnem izrazu presegajo meje ustaljenih form in jih prepoznavamo kot zelo pomembne na področju uprizoritvenih umetnosti.

Ne vsebuje grobih vlaken, zato se lahko meša v kremasto pasto, brez nastanka grudic. Enostavne se izpere.                             Indigo zagotavlja intenzivno temno / črno barvo, ki se ovije okoli keratina las in tako ne opravlja le funkcije barvanja, ampak ščiti in neguje lase.                             Opomba: Blond lasje bi morali biti dvakrat pobarvani z indigom oziroma najprej z rdečo kano, pred nanosom indiga, za temen rezultat. Sive lase najprej pobarvajte z rdečo kano, šele nato jih pobarvajte z indigom.                             Uporaba:                             Zadostno količino prahu pomešajte z mrzlo/toplo vodo in pustite mirovati 10 minut preden pasto nanesete na čiste suhe lase.

It does not contain coarse fibers, so it can be mixed into a creamy paste, without the formation of lumps. It is easy to rinse. Indigo provides an intense dark / black color that wraps around keratin hair and thus performs not only the coloring function but protects and nourishes the hair. Note: Blond hair should be dyed twice with indigo or first with red henna, before applying indigo, for the result. First, dye the gray hair with red henna, then dyed with indigo. Use: Mix a sufficient amount of dust with cold/warm water and leave to rest for 10 minutes before applying the paste to clean dry hair. For better existence, you can add a small amount of natron or a pinch of salt to the product. Leave the paste on your hair for 1-2 hours and then flush your hair without the use of shampoo. Use a small amount of balm as needed. For the last flushing, it is advisable to sour rinse with a mixture of water and vinegar. This extends the color results.

Povsem enako, kot bi ga deponiral pri notarju, na sodišču ali kje drugje, kakor to dopušča zakonodaja. To nakazilo je bilo izvršeno v avgustu 2014 kot posledica nezakonitega poskusa prevzema vodenja Zavoda AIPA s strani oseb, med katerimi so tudi take, ki so tesno povezane z drugo kolektivno organizacijo, ki vse od dodelitve dovoljenja Zavodu AIPA skuša le-tega onemogočiti.                             Edini razlog te hrambe na fiduciarnem računu odvetnika je bila skrb, da nezakoniti "prevzemniki" ne bi prenesli teh sredstev na račune, kjer upravičeni in zakoniti imetniki pravic do zbranih nadomestil ne bi več mogli priti do svojega denarja. Da je bila ta poteza vodstva povsem na mestu in v celoti upravičena, kažejo dejanja nezakonitih prevzemnikov, ki so si protipravno prilastili vse ostalo, do česar so imeli v tistem kratkem obdobju dostop (nezakonito razpolaganje z bančnimi izpiski, pohištvom ter drugimi premičnimi predmeti...). Prepričani smo, da bi nezakonito – tako kot vse ostalo, do česar so imeli dostop - odtujili tudi denarna sredstva.                             Sodišče je kasneje pravnomočno odločilo, da je bilo ravnanje "prevzemnikov" nezakonito, kar potrjuje torej pravilnost takratne odločitve organa upravljanja Zavoda AIPA – Sveta zavoda, da sredstva zavaruje tako, da jih začasno prenese na fiduciarni račun.                             Zato namen začasne hrambe sredstev na fiduciarnem računu seveda ni bila nekakšna varščina za morebitne postopke v primeru razrešitve zakonitega vodstva Zavoda AIPA, temveč zaščita sredstev imetnikov pravic. To je nenazadnje zapisano tudi v izseku v članku omenjenega zapisnika skupščine z dne 4.3.2015, podrobneje pa v nadaljevanju tega zapisnika, ki ga uredništvo, žal, ni želelo predstaviti.                             Za prikaz nasprotnih dejstev je potrebno pojasniti tudi naravo fiduciarnega računa odvetnika: sredstva na njem niso odvetnikova (!), nanje ni moč seči z morebitno izvršbo nad odvetnikom ipd., temveč so sredstva na fiduciarnem računu še vedno last stranke – odvetnik jih zanjo le hrani. Zato je seveda nepravilno govoriti o 2-milijonskem avansu odvetniku, saj ni šlo za noben avans, temveč hrambo denarja za Zavod AIPA.                             	341	The AIPA Institute did not indicate a lawyer's advance to the lawyer mentioned in the article, as incorrectly presented in the editorial board, but deposited with a lawyer. kept money on his fiduciary account.

Te inzulinske črpalke se lahko sprožijo tudi za ivbrizgati inzulina, ko bolnik poje obrok.                             Sistemi umetne trebušne slinavke združujejo ta dva procesa v tako imenovani sistem "zaprte zanke". Monitor glukoze je nameščen pod bolnikovo kožo, poleg inzulinske črpalke, ki omogoča napravi, da samostojno nadzoruje raven glukoze.                             Številna klinična preskušanja so pokazala, da je ta umetna trebušna slinavka zelo uspešna pri vzdrževanju bolnikove ravni glukoze. Odstranjevanje potrebe, da mora bolnik nenehno spremljati svoj krvni sladkor, je tudi velik plus.                             Eden izzivov, s katerimi se soočajo ti sistemi, je majhna zamuda med vbrizgavanjem inzulina, ki lahko traja do dve uri, da doseže najvišjo raven v krvnem obtoku.

V čem je razlika? Hvala za odgovore! Če se vpišem v zemljiško knjigo v Hurghadi, potem ne morem nepremičnine prodati v 5 letih, pridobim pa lahko njihovo vizo. S proksijem sem vpisana kot lastnik, vendar pa nimam pravice do njihove vize( lahko pa nepremičnino prodam). Razumem prav?                             zanimivo, da se doslej se nihce ni javil od tistih, ki tako veselo prodajajo egipcanske nepremicnine Slovencem... ja, vi samo prinesite denar in nic ne sprasujte jaz ne vem o nepremicninah nic, proksi je zame nov pojem. bom morala malo vprasat. prijateljica, ki je kupila stanovanje v Hurgadi, ima vizo za eno leto. vem le to, da na Sinaju ne mores biti lastnik zemljisca, ce si tujec. pred dvema letoma je v veljavo stopila uredba, da niti Egipcani ne morejo biti lastniki. Vse se najema za 99 let. To je en tak obrambni mehanizem, ki preprecuje, da bi Izraelci preko Anglezev vse pokupili in aneksirali Izraelu (kot so sistematsko naredili s Palestino). Jim z vojno ni uspelo, zato so Egipcani pripravljeni tudi na bolj "prefinjene" oblike okupacije. Sinajski polotok, Boba... ne arabski _________________ Ni vse zlato, kar se sveti. Ni vse dopust, kar je Sharm el-Sheik.                             boba                             Glede na to, da Arabski polotok na zahodu meji na Afriko (po enciklopediji), sem razumela, da je Sinajski polotok del Arabskega polotoka, kajti Sinaj se smatra za Azijo. Očitno si Pojoča edina, ki ti je do klepeta z mano. Ciao! (lepo je tebi, ki si na 35 stopinjah, ti kar zavidam!)                             Jaz sem bila odsotna pa verjetno prepozno odgovarjam...čeprav nevem kaj točno naj odgovorim.... Uglavnem, v Hurghadi si kot tujec lahko lastnik zemlje in se vpišeš v zemljiško knjigo kar ponavadi, po mojih info, ne delajo v veliki meri prav zaradi tega razloga, ker potem nepremičnine kao ne moreš 5 let prodat. Tudi v Sharmu se lahko vpišete v zemljiško knjigo ampak ne moreš pa biti lastnik zemlje....dobiš samo pogodbo za 99 let.... lahko pa nepremčnino prodaš kadarkoli....                             	384	Published: 11 Oct 2010 14:49 Title of the message: Real estate in Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikhu I wonder what the difference between the acquisition of real estate is foreigners in Hurghada or.

Likovna kolonija Umetniki za Karitas Na Sinjem vrhu nad Ajdovščino kot vsako leto, kljub koronavirusu poteka likovna kolonija Umetniki za Karitas. Tam so se v ponedeljek 17. avgusta zbrali vsi povabljeni umetniki, ki bodo ustvarjali do petka 21. avgusta. Obiskali smo jih tudi z mikrofonom in fotoaparatom.                             Tudi letos je za izbor poskrbela strokovna ekipa pod vodstvom Anamarije Stibilj Šajn. Prošnji Karitas je prijazno pokimalo deset izbranih ustvarjalcev ter častni gost.                             Dogajanje na Sinjem vrhu je bilo prilagojeno preventivnim ukrepom covid-19. Darovi za likovna dela so tokrat namenjeni otrokom umetnikov, ki so zaradi korone ostali brez rednih dohodkov. Geslo tokratne kolonije in prodajnih razstav 2020/2021 je »... Vi ste luč sveta...« Ravnateljica škofijske Karitas Koper Jožica Ličen, ki je organizacijska duša tega projekta že vseh 26 let, je bila nad odzivom sodelujočih navdušena. Povedala je še: „25 let so umetniki darovali svoja dela in talent za druge, zato je prav, da se jim šestindvajseto leto oddolžimo tako, da bomo zbrana sredstva namenili otrokom tistih ustvarjalcev, ki jim je korona kriza dodobra oklestila družinski proračun. Ne samo slikarjem, tudi glasbenikom in drugim umetnikom."                             Častni gost Veljko Toman, je povedal, da mu je v veliko veselje, da lahko sodeluje na tej koloniji.                             Škofjeloška ustvarjalka Barbara Demšar je na koloniji slavila tudi rojstni dan, na Sinji vrh pa je prišla z velikim veseljem. Prav tako se je klicu Karitas odzvala slikarka in likovna pedagoginja Silva Copič. Med drugim je povedala, da se je v času epidemije umaknila v hišo svojih prednikov in da je najbolj pogrešala pristni stik med ljudmi. V tem času so odpadli številni dogodki, to se še posebej pozna na kulturnem področju. Nekako izgleda, da so se ljudje zaprli vase je ugotavljal Viktor Šest. Matej Metlikovič, sicer reden obiskovalec in darovalec za Karitas, je letos na Sinjem vrhu ustvarjal na temo gesla kolonije Vi ste luč sveta.                             Novomeški slikar Janko Orač je na Sinjem vrhu ustvaril triptih s pogledom na Nanos, morje in Vipavsko dolino. Za otroke v stiski pa sta ustvarjala tudi profesor na Likovni akademiji v Ljubljani Milan Erič in njegova soproga Draga Davitkova. Slikarka, kiparka in ilustratorka, ki ustvarja tudi na literarnem področju Erna Ferjanič, prihaja iz Rogaške Slatine. Pravi, da je v začetku, ko je izbruhnila epidemija koronavirusa, sploh ni mogla ustvarjati, najbolj pa je pogrešala stik z ljudmi. Magistra umetnosti Breda Šturm iz Ljubljane, pravi, da je z vsakim novim delom treba obrniti nov list. Slikar in pedagog Skender Bajrovič že vrsto let ustvarja na temo vode. Prav tako je ob geslu tokratne kolonije svetlobo poiskal v vodi, zelo pa je pohvalil organizatorje in prizadevne gostitelje družino Vidmar, ki skrbi za Penzion na Sinjem vrhu.                             Poleg vseh naštetih, so se v sinjevrških ateljejih ustavili številni drugi gostje od strokovnih sodelavcev, do nekdanjih sodelujočih. Eden od njih je bil goriški slikar Andrej Kosič, ki v akciji za Karitas vidi klic k solidarnosti.                             	478	Erna Ferjanič | (Photo: Jože Bartolj) Being the light of the world! 26.

Saj vemo, da bi se po dolgem teku najraje sesedli na kavč in obsedeli, a to bi vam prej škodilo kot koristilo. Zato se po treningu raje prvo dobro raztegnite, saj boste tako povečali elastičnost in zmanjšali možnost, da bi se počutili otrdeli.                             Na kaj morate paziti, ko se raztezate? Pazite, da z raztezanjem ne boste pretiravali! Raztezanje lahko povzroči manjše nelagodje v mišicah, a ne tudi bolečin. Če jo začutite, je možno, da ste se poškodovali. Sicer pa je dobro, da med raztezanjem tudi globoko dihate, saj ste boste tako tudi sprostili.                             Kakšne vaje izvajati? Vsekakor vam med raztezanjem ne bo potrebno poskakovati, ampak bo dovolj, če boste le dobro (a previdno) raztegnili svoje telo. Da boste lažje začeli, pa smo izbrskali nekaj najpogostejših in tudi učinkovitih vaj za to ... Stegna: Desno nogo raztegnite tako, da bo peta na tleh pred vami. Koleno leve noge upognite in z boki počasi drsite navpično navzdol ter nato nazaj v prvotni položaj. Trup naj bo vseskozi vzravnan. Vajo ponovite še z drugo nogo. Meča: S stopali stojte na stopnici ali privzdignjeni podlagi, desno nogo potisnite nazaj tako, da bo peta visela čez rob. Nato desno nogo potisnite navzdol tako, da začutite, kako se mečna mišica zategne. Isto ponovite še z drugo nogo. Kvadriceps: Stojte na levi nogi in desno nogo privzdignite nazaj ter z roko primite gleženj ali stopalo z levo roko. Nežno pritisnite stopalo proti zadnjici. Kolena naj bodo poravnana in pazite, da ne upogibate hrbta. Vajo ponovite še z drugo nogo. Zadnjične mišice: Namestite desno nogo tik nad levim kolenom in se spustite navzdol kot da bi želeli narediti počep. Primite se stene ali stola, da boste lažje držali ravnotežje, nato pa nežno potisnite navzdol desno koleno. Vajo ponovite še z drugo nogo. Prsi: Stojite z nogami razkoračenimi v širini vaših ramen. Prepletite prste skupaj za glavo nad vratom. Stisnite lopatice skupaj medtem ko s komolci silite navzven in nazaj, da razprete prsni koš. Roke pa lahko nato tudi dvignete iz nad glave, kot da bi hoteli poseči proti nebu, saj se bose tudi tako lahko dobro raztegnili.                             	358	5 Running exercises for runners see how to stretch properly after strenuous workout.

UV žarki lahko prodrejo prav do očesne mrežnice in jo poškodujejo. Večina UV žarkov se zbere na roženici, nekateri pa prehajajo skozi zenico in se absorbirajo v očesni leči. Škodljivi vplivi UV svetlobe se akumulirajo in dolgotrajna izpostavljenost UV žarkom lahko privede do sive mrene ali kožnega raka na vekah.                             Gradnja v sončnih zimskih dneh, delo na morju, vožnja, delo na smučiščih...so delovne okoliščine, kjer so zaščitna očala nepogrešljivo zaščitno sredstvo za vaše oči. Sončna svetloba je večsmerna. Ko se odbije od ravne površine (voda, cesta, vetrobransko steklo ...) se os nihanja spremeni v polarizirano svetlobo. Močna svetloba nemudoma povzroči neugodje in zmanjša zaznavanje in kontrast. Tega ni mogoče preprečiti z navadnimi lečami. Močna svetloba povzroči solzenje, motnjo vida, utrujenost in dolgoročno pešanje vida. Polarizacijski filter, ki ga vsebujejo očala POLARIZED, zadržujejo kristale, ki ovirajo vodoravno polarizirano svetlobo.                             	159	Eye Protection from glare - Bolle Safety Glasses on January 9, 2012 Reduce the stress and fatigue of your eyes with darkened and polarizing glasses of Bolle Safety.

Kako brezpogojna je njihova empatija, pa dokazuje ganljiva zgodba o herojski psički iz Argentine, ki je rešila življenje zapuščenemu novorojenčku tako, da ga je vzela pod svoje okrilje. Brezdomna psička, ki so jo poimenovali China, je ravno skotila šest svojih mladičkov, ko je iz bližnjega smetnjaka zaslišala jok novorojenčka, ki ga je njegova štirinajstletna mati zavrgla. Psičkin neverjetni materinski instinkt je novorojenčka rešil gotove smrti. Nekako ji je uspelo prenesti dojenčka v svoje leglo, ne da bi ga pri tem poškodovala. Kmalu po tem so dojenčkov jok zaslušali tudi sosedje, ki so poskrbeli, da je deček dobil zdravstveno oskrbo in da bo z njim vse v najlepšem redu. Za to pa se lahko zahvali pasji mamici, ki je dokazala, da pasja ljubezen res ne pozna meja.

How unconditional their empathy is is evidenced by the moving story of the hero puppy from Argentina, who saved the life of an abandoned newborn baby by taking it under her wing. The homeless puppy, named China, just gave birth to six of her puppies when she heard a newborn baby cry from a nearby trash, which his fourteen -year -old mother discarded. The puppy's incredible maternal instinct saved the newborn baby certain deaths. Somehow, she managed to transfer the baby to her litter without damaging him. Shortly afterwards, the baby's crying was also due to neighbors, who made sure the boy had medical care and that everything would be in the best order.

Jaz mislim, da za to, ker nudi veliko zabave. Če se želite malce sprostit, odmisliti svoje vsakdanje opravke in probleme, potem je stand up komedija vedno ena od boljših izbir.                             Ste bili že kdaj poročeni?                             Sem bil. V sedmem razredu osnovne šole sem se v šoli v naravi poročil s svojo simpatijo. V bistvu je bil to zaključni dogodek te šole v naravi. Takrat nas je kar nekaj parov dahnilo neusodni DA. V bistvu se nikoli nisva ločila, tako da sva tehnično še vedno poročena. Samo ne vem, če bi to bilo všeč njenemu zdajšnjemu partnerju.                             Nekje ste morali dobiti izkušnje, da ste si lahko tako dobro izmislili predstavo, kajne?                             Predstava ne govori samo o poroki, ampak predvsem o odnosih, iskanju odnosa in kaj vse se ti zgodi na tej poti. Drugače pa lahko za stvari, ki jih še ne poznaš, najbolje uporabiš domišljijo in marsikaj ti lahko pade na pamet.                             Glede na to, da ste s predstavo že gostovali v Trbovljah, kako ste bili zadovoljni s publiko?                             Super je bilo v Trbovljah. Jaz sem se zelo zabaval, saj se je poznalo, da se je tudi publika prišla zabavat. Če se ljudje pridejo zabavat, potem je veliko bolj zabavno nastopati zanje.                             Kako sicer poznate Zasavje?                             Kot regijo, kamor rad pridem nastopat.                             Razen nekaj želja po slikanju in avtogramih še nisem bil oblegan v zaodrju. Mislim, da bi moral bit rock zvezda, da bi se mi to dogajalo.                             Ko boste v Zagorju, ali bodo imele obiskovalke kakšno možnost, da se z vami po predstavi fotografirajo, vas pocukajo za rokav?                             Seveda. Po predstavi se z veseljem slikam s tistimi, ki si to zaželijo.                             Tudi z obiskovalci?                             Haha, a ste vi tudi komedijantka? Seveda, s komerkoli. Tudi s psom se lahko slikam, če bo dal tačko.                             Poznate kakšen komad zasavske skupine Orlek?                             Najbolj sem si zapomnil Perkmandeljca, ker sem bil prvič, ko sem na TV-ju videl video spot, navdušen nad muziko in spotom.                             Vam tekne kakšna zasavska jed: recimo funšterc ali grenadirmarš, kot rečemo pri nas praženemu krompirju z makaroni?                             Funšterc definitvno, za grenadirmarš pa prvič slišim. Ampak se mi zdi, da sem ga v študentskih letih tudi sam nevede, da delam zagorsko jed, naredil za večerjo samo zato, ker nisem imel dovolj krompirja ali dovolj makaronov za samostojno jed. Pa sem malo pokombiniral.                             Ste že kdaj slišali za Jamatlon?                             Sem slišal in se mi zdi zelo zanimiva preizkušnja za nekoga, ki rad hodi po jamah.                             Bi se ga upali udeležiti?                             Ne gre toliko za upati kot bolj za želeti. Moram priznati, da grem raje v gozd kot v jamo. Jame mi nikoli niso bile najbolj privlačne. Vendar, če mi obljubite, da skupaj poiščemo in najdemo Perkmandeljca, potem pa z veseljem.                             Pojma nimam, kaj so to škrince. A so dobre? A jih domače delate ali jih kupite pa samo preimenujete?                             	466	Vid Valic: "After the show, I am happy to take pictures with those who want it." 146 Why is it worth seeing your future ex -husband? I think for that because it offers a lot of fun. If you want to relax a little, think about your daily chores and problems, then stand up comedy is always one of the better choices. Have you ever been married? I've been. In the seventh grade of elementary school, I married my sympathy in nature. Basically, this was the closing event of this school in nature. At the time, quite a few couples breathed us unannounced. In fact, we never divorced, so we are still technically married. I just don't know if it would like her current partner. You had to get an experience somewhere so you could make up the show so well, right? The show not only talks about marriage, but above all about relationships, finding a relationship and what happens to you along the way. Otherwise, for things you don't know yet, you can best use your imagination and many things can fall by heart. Given that you have already played with the show in Trbovlje, how satisfied were you with the audience? It was great in Trbovlje. I had a lot of fun, as it was known that the audience came to have fun too. If people come to have fun, then it's much more fun to perform for them. How else do you know Zasavje? As a region where I like to come. Except for a few wishes for painting and autographs, I have not yet been besieged in the back. I think I should be a rock star so that this would happen to me. When you are in Zagorje, will you have any option to take pictures with you after the show, you are knocked by your sleeve? Of course. After the show, I am happy to take pictures with those who want it. Also with visitors? Haha, are you also a comedian? Of course, with anyone. I can also take a picture with a dog if he gives a paw. Do you know a piece of Zasava Group Orlek? I remembered Perkmandeljak most because I was the first time I saw a video on TV, excited about music and a spot. Do you have any Zasavska dish: say Funšterc or Grenadirmarš, as we say roasted potatoes with macaroni? Funšterc definitely, and for the first time I hear about Genadirmarš. But it seems to me that in my college years, I also unknowingly made it for dinner, just because I didn't have enough potatoes or enough macaroni for an independent dish. But I poconed a little. Have you ever heard of Jamatlon? I have heard and seems to me to be a very interesting ordeal for someone who likes to walk in the caves. Would you dare to attend? It's not so much about hoping as more about wanting. I have to admit that I prefer to go to the woods than to the cave. The caves have never been the most attractive to me. However, if you promise me to find and find a Perkmandeljak together, then with pleasure. I have no idea what they are. Are they good? Do you work at home or buy them but just rename them?

Prve zmage v tem rangu tekmovanju se je razveselil Martin Fritz, ki je po skokih v Kranju zasedal tretje mesto. V ciljnem finišu je bil za 0,4 sekunde boljši od Philippa Orterja, tretji pa je bil David Pommer.                             Najboljše izhodišče izmed Slovencev je imel na pet kilometrski tekaški preizkušnji na Pokljuki Aljaž Osterc. Član SSK Velenje je na premierni mednarodni tekmi sicer na teku nekoliko izgubil, tako da je zdrsnil iz 19. na 44. mesto. Na koncu je bil tako naš najboljši Borut Mavc, ki je na Rudnem polju napredoval za 17. mest in se na koncu razveselil 20. mesta. Luka Oblak je deseto tekmo alpskega pokala končal kot 32., Aljaž Ogrinc je bil 38., Tomaž Seme 40. in Vid Vrhovnik 41.                             "S tekmami sem zadovoljen, predvsem z včerajšnjo. Na prejšnjih tekmah alpskega pokala, ki so bile v Planici in na Pokljuki, ter na mladinski svetovnem prvenstvu smo imeli nekoliko smole. Tako nismo naredili pričakovanih rezultatov. V soboto smo dokazali, da smo dobro trenirali. Fantje so odskakali bolje kot na treningih. Seveda imajo še veliko rezerv na skakalnici. Oba dneva so odtekli super. Danes smo imeli nekaj težav na skakalnici. Bila je dokaj neregularna tekma, razmere so se zelo menjale. Za vse tekmovalce tako ni bilo enako. Po skokih nam ni najbolje kazalo, od njih smo pričakovali nekaj več. Žal so tekmovalci imeli slabe pogoje in bi več težko iztržili. Pokazali so, da smo dobro trenirali in da smo na pravi poti. Definitivno je to vzpodbuda za naprej, za trdo delo," je analizo dvodnevnega dogajanja napravil vodja mladinske ekipe nordijskih kombinatorcev Anže Obreza.                             Anže Obreza [foto: Aleš Gros]                             Na sobotni preizkušnji je na skakalnici deževalo, vendar so bile razmere za vse tekmovalce konstantne. "Veter se v soboto ni obračal. Na Pokljuki je bilo pa potem težko. Ni bilo sicer mrzlo, vendar je pihalo in močno snežilo. Bila je težka tekma, a so se fantje znašli in vsi napredovali," je varovance pohvalil Obreza.                             Sedaj tekmovalce čakajo še domače tekme in finale alpskega pokala 2. in 3. marca v francoskem Chaux Neuvu. "Na teh tekmah upamo na dobro uvrstitev. Mislim, da bomo to uspeli tudi realizirati," je dejal Obreza.                             V vmesnem obdobju pa bodo seveda še trenirali, da bodo tekmovalci odpravili napake, ki se jim še dogajajo. "Dokazali smo, da spadamo v to konkurenco in se lahko enakovredno kosamo s preostalimi. Seveda pridejo vzponi in padci, kar je za športno kariero povsem normalno. Delali bomo naprej čim bolj kvalitetno in odpravljali rezerve, kar jih imamo.

Precej vode je že preteklo od takrat, ko je John Lennon sanjavo prepeval o tem, kako lepo bi bilo, če bi bili ljudje drugačni. V mladinskih in študentskih skupinah smo podobno zasanjani mrmrali slovensko različico “Ko bi ljudje ljubili se kot bratje in sestre...” Topli občutki pri srcu niso dolgo trajali, hipiji so se postarali in zresnili, namesto vsesplošne harmonije in pravičnosti nemočno opazujemo, kako se uveljavljajo vedno bolj grobe oblike nasilja in neenakosti. Je boljši svet nedosegljiva utopija? Je med sanjami in resničnostjo res nepremostljiv prepad?                             Stojim v vrsti pred blagajno, da si naročim nekaj malega za zajtrk. Oči se mi pasejo po mičnih plakatih, s katerih se mi ponujajo idealizirani rogljič, kapučino in vrsta drugih dobrot ter napitkov. Zalotil sem se, kako sem jih že začel použivati. Ko mi bo natakar postregel in bom ugriznil v rogljič in srknil kapučin, bom užival tisto idealizirano podobo s plakata, ki je že spodbudila mojo domišljijo. Pecivo in napitek sta v moji izkušnji neizbrisno zaznamovana s predstavo o njima, ki se si jo ustvaril med čakanjem v vrsti.                             To prepletanje virtualnega in snovnega dobro poznajo propagandisti. Tisti komercialni ga uporabijo za to, da nam prodajo svojo robo. Oni politične vrste pa za to, da nam slikajo lepši svet, ki nam ga bodo pričarali v zameno za našo podporo. Propagandisti točno vedo , da si človek stvar ali dejanje najprej predstavi, si ustvari umsko podobo o njej, šele potem jo sprejme ali odkloni. To je lepo povedano v zgodbi o padcu Adama in Eve: skušnjavec jima je najprej slikovito opisal učinke prepovedanega sadeža. Onadva sta si zadevo predstavila, si jo “pred-očila” in šele potem segla po nesrečnem jabolku: “Žena je videla, da je drevo dobro za jed, mikavno za oči in vredno poželenja, ker daje spoznanje. Vzela je torej od njegovega sadu in jedla, dala pa je tudi možu, ki je bil z njo, in je jedel.”                             Zdaj pa zares: predstavljajte si svet, v katerem vaša sreča ni odvisna od tega, kaj bodo drugi mislili o vas, kakšen avto ima sosed, koliko zaslužite in kaj si lahko privoščite. Že res, da je tudi to pomembno, ampak sreče pa kljub vsemu ne more dati. Ste zmožni predstaviti si sebe, kako ste pravzaprav blagoslovljeni, ko živite bolje kot ogromna večina ljudi, ko vam za razliko od milijonov ni treba trepetati za življenje? Ste si zmožni predstavljati, da so osebe, ki se vam upirajo in bi jih najraje žive požrli, pravzaprav čisto spodobni ljudje, podobni vam in si želijo predvsem živeti v miru in slogi? Si znate predstavljati svet, v katerem so otroci, mož ali žena ter stari ljudje blagoslov in ne nadloga ali strošek. Ljubezen, mir in vse drugo, po čemer hrepenimo, pač ne rastejo na drevesu in se ne skrivajo v rudnikih. Vse to ustvarimo mi, z vsakim trenutkom, ki ga posvetimo sočloveku.                             Če ste si vse to to zmožni predstavljati, potem ste z eno nogo že vstopili v ta svet.                             	486	Imagine that ... a lot of water has passed since John Lennon sang to the dream about how nice it would be if people were different.

48973	CLASSLA-web.sl.797618	http://www.seesky.si/hujsanje-in-jutranja-sportna-aktivnost/	seesky.si	Instruction	Ali lahko hujšanje pospešimo še kako drugače razen s tem, da zmanjšamo dnevni vnos hrane? Odgovor je seveda, da lahko. Eden izmed najboljših načinov, kako pospešiti hujšanje, je aerobna vadba zjutraj, preden smo pojedli zajtrk. Sliši se precej kruto, vendar je to eden izmed boljših načinov, kako dodati v hujšanje še kak element, ki bo pohitril pot do želene postave. Kako takšna jutranja aerobna vadba sploh vpliva na izgubljanje maščobe? Preden gremo spat imamo po navadi večerjo. Nekateri nekaj ur prej, spet drugi pa radi povečerjajo tik preden zaspijo, ker tako pač boljše spijo. Ampak ne glede na to, kdaj so pojedli zadnji obrok, je pred njimi spanec, ki traja več ur. Hujšanje se nadaljuje tudi v tem času, saj telo porablja energijo tudi, ko mi spimo. Bitje srca, dihanje, delovanje notranjih organov, prebava in drugi procesi zahtevajo energijo, ki jo telo rabi iz različnih virov. Kadar se zjutraj zbudimo, smo tešči, kar pomeni, da smo imeli nek krajši nočni post. To stanje lahko s pridom izkoristimo. Hujšanje lahko pospešimo, če gremo na tešče kolesariti ali pa teči, ker bo telo kot energijo rabilo svojo lastno maščobo. Če bi recimo zjutraj pojedli zajtrk, ki bi vključeval nekaj maščob in ogljikovih hidratov, potem bi telo med tekom ali kolesarjenjem porabljalo te vire, ki bi jih pred aktivnostjo zaužili. Tako pa se hujšanje lahko nadaljuje precej intenzivno, če se odločimo za takšno jutranjo telovadbo. Tu je potrebno še opozoriti, da se v tem primeru priporoča zmerna aktivnost, kar pomeni, da je kolesarjenje ali tek lahkoten in ne prehiter.                             	256	Can weight loss be accelerated differently except by reducing daily intake of food? The answer is, of course, that you can. One of the best ways to accelerate weight loss is aerobic workout in the morning before eating breakfast. It sounds quite cruel, but this is one of the better ways to add to the weight loss another element that will speed up the path to the desired figure. How does such morning aerobic workout affect fat loss? We usually have dinner before going to bed. Some hours earlier, but others like to increase just before they fall asleep, because they sleep better. But no matter when they ate the last meal, there is a sleep that lasts for hours. Weight loss continues during this time as the body consumes energy even when we sleep. A heartbeat, breathing, internal organs, digestion and other processes require the energy that the body uses from different sources. When we wake up in the morning, we are fasting, which means we had some shorter night fasting. We can make good use of this situation. Weight loss can be accelerated by cycling or running on an empty stomach because the body will need its own fat as energy. For example, if you ate breakfast in the morning, which would include some fat and carbohydrates, then the body would use these resources during running or cycling, which would be consumed before the activity. Thus, weight loss can continue quite intensively if we decide on such a morning exercise. It should also be noted here that moderate activity is recommended in this case, which means that cycling or running is easy and not too fast.	Instruction		Can weight loss be accelerated differently except by reducing daily intake of food?The answer is, of course, that you can.One of the best ways to accelerate weight loss is aerobic workout in the morning before eating breakfast.It sounds quite cruel, but this is one of the better ways to add to the weight loss another element that will speed up the path to the desired figure.How does such morning aerobic workout affect fat loss?We usually have dinner before going to bed.Some hours earlier, but others like to increase just before they fall asleep, because they sleep better.But no matter when they ate the last meal, there is a sleep that lasts for hours.Weight loss continues during this time as the body consumes energy even when we sleep.A heartbeat, breathing, internal organs, digestion and other processes require the energy that the body uses from different sources.When we wake up in the morning, we are fasting, which means we had some shorter night fasting.We can make good use of this situation.Weight loss can be accelerated by cycling or running on an empty stomach because the body will need its own fat as energy.For example, if you ate breakfast in the morning, which would include some fat and carbohydrates, then the body would use these resources during running or cycling, which would be consumed before the activity.Thus, weight loss can continue quite intensively if we decide on such a morning exercise.It should also be noted here that moderate activity is recommended in this case, which means that cycling or running is easy and not too fast.

Najprej se dogajanje odvija na beli površini, Emily in različica iz prihodnosti imata izrisane samo osnovne dele telesa. Vizualna podoba se popolnoma spremeni, ko se podata na potovanje po Emilyjem umu. Spomini in čustva, po katerih potujeta, so prikazani v spranih odtenkih in abstraktnih oblikah, ki se razprostirajo po prostoru, ki spominja na vesolje. Jasna je razlika med nepravilnimi organskimi oblikami spominov in hladno natančnostjo digitalne Emily, ki je v morju spominov zmedena. Vsak spomin je prikazan drugače; spomin iz otroštva Hertzfeldt avtor prikaže s podobami kadečih se dimnikov termoelektrarne, ki jih ima Emily za »zelene planote«, s čimer se dotakne tudi tematike okoljevarstva.                             V prihodnosti so Emilyjin um prenesli v kopijo, ki ji je na las podobna, vendar malo manj človeška, bolj mehanska – ne zna se čustveno odzivati, obnaša se strogo uradno, govori z resnim, monotonim glasom. Kopija se v določenem trenutku spomni, da zna igrati na klavir, ko pa poskusi igrati, zaigra le nekaj naključnih tonov. Svojo nezmožnost igranja klavirja obrazloži s tem, da ga je starejša verzija kopije sicer znala igrati, vendar se je s ponovnim kopiranjem sposobnost izgubila, ostal pa je le medel spomin. Tako kot spomin na koncu zbledi tudi Emilyjina kopija, s čimer avtor opomni na minljivost še tako izpopolnjene tehnologije.                             	230	The erased emotion of the girl Emily is visited by a digitized copy of her from the future, trying to find all the feelings and memories she has lost over time. First, the events take place on the white surface, Emily and the version from the future have only the base parts of the body. The visual image completely changes as they embark on an emily mind trip. The memories and emotions they travel through are shown in washed shades and abstract shapes that spread across a space that is reminiscent of space. Clear is the difference between irregular organic forms of memories and the cold precision of digital emily, which is confused in the sea of ​​memories. Each memory is shown differently; Hertzfeldt's childhood memory is shown by the images of smoking chimneys of the thermal power plant that Emily has for "green plateaus", thus touching on the topic of environmentalism. In the future, Emily's mind has been transferred to a copy that is similar to her hair but a little less human, more mechanical - he cannot respond emotionally, behaves strictly officially, speaking with a serious, monotony voice. At some point, the copy remembers that he can play the piano, but when he tries to play, he plays only a few random tones. He explains his inability to play the piano by the fact that the older version of the copy knew how to play him, but by re -copying, the ability was lost, and only Medel memory remained. Like the memory, Emily's copy fades, which reminds the author of the transience of even sophisticated technology.
