Hegel, who, in particular, noted that \"the content of art is the ideal and its form is a sensual figurative embodiment.\"You can read more about the inseparable unity of content and form in the work of GV Gegel (1770-1831) \"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" (1817).\n\nLet's go to another classic - Russian critic V. Belinsky, whose unity of form and content illustrated the figurative analogy of unity of body and body: “In a work of art, the idea (ie content) with form should be organically merged as a soul with a body, so that destroyForm - means to destroy the idea, and vice versa ... The unity of the idea with the form is so significant in art that neither the far -fetched idea can be made in a great form nor the beautiful form can be an expression of a contrived idea. \"\n\nSome modern scholars offer even new terms, emphasizing the dialectical unity of content and form: content or formist.

{"id":591,"text":"Most of our contemporaries believe that it does not require proof that empirical knowledge depends or is derived from perception.However, Plato and the philosophers of some other schools have a different theory, namely - that comes through the sense organs, is not worthy to be called \"knowledge\" and the only real knowledge should only deal with concepts.According to this view, \"2 + 2 = 4\" is a true knowledge, but such a statement as \"snow white\", is so full of ambiguity and uncertainty that it cannot find a place in a collection of philosophical truths.\n\nThis view may go to Parmenide, but in its clear form, the philosophical world owes Plato's view.In this section, I intend to consider Plato's criticism that knowledge is the same as perception;This criticism is the first half of the tenet [150].\n\nThis dialogue attempts to define \"knowledge\", which ends, however, a negative conclusion;Several definitions were proposed and rejected, but a definition that would be considered satisfactory was not put forward.\n\nThe first of the proposed definitions and the only thing I will consider is formulated by Teeta:\n\n\"In my opinion, something knows something that knows, and as it seems to me, knowledge is nothing more than feeling.\"\n\nSocrates identifies this theory with Protagora's theory that \"a man is a measure of all things\", that is, \"... who seems to me every thing, it is for me, and what you, what is the same, in turn, for you, in turn, for you, for you.You \". Socrates adds,\" It turns out that feeling is always a feeling of being, and as knowledge it is infallible. \"\n\nMuch of the next argument concerns the characteristics of perception;As soon as it is done, it is easy to prove that such a thing that was perception could not be knowledge.\n\nTo the theory of Protagora Socrates adds the theory of Heraclitus, that everything is always changing, that is, \"all things we attribute the concept of being are in the process of formation.\"Plato considers this correct for sensual objects, but not for real knowledge objects.However, throughout the dialogue, his positive theories remain in the shade.\n\nFrom the theory of Heraclitus, even if it can only be applied to sensual objects, the definition of knowledge as perception and should be necessary that knowledge is about what is in formation, not what is.\n\nThere are some difficulties in this matter.We are told that since 6 is more than 4, but less than 12.6 at the same time, both large and small, which is a contradiction.Socrates is now above Teeta, who is not yet fully raised by young men;But in a few years, the Socrates will be below Teeta.Therefore, Socrates at the same time both high and low growth.The idea of expression with relationships, apparently, puzzled Plato, as it was with most great philosophers to Hegel inclusive.These difficulties, however, do not have a special attitude towards the argumentation and can be ignored.\n\nReturning to perception, we see that it was considered as due to the interaction between the object and any body of feelings, both, according to the theory of Heraclitus, always change and, changing, change the mental object of perception.Socrates notes that when he is healthy, he finds the wine sweet, but when it is a patient, he finds it sour.Here the change in the perception of the person causes a change in the mental object of perception.\n\nThe theory of Protagoras is objected to the theory, but in the future some of them are taken back.They insist","metadata":{"text_id":"macocu.uk.20665684"},"label":["Information\/Explanation"],"Comments":[]}
